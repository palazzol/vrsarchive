prevent cross-posting across universes: on receipt,
	use first universe in $NEWSCTL/universes only
modify Path: on reading instead of on writing (in headers.c)?
avoid array overruns: use malloc for string storage

remove embarrassing comments
more packaging effort a la Horton

test long headers: >512 bytes, >1024 bytes
test and read all code (including sh scripts) before release

D news idea:
	read batch into memory (assumes VM); compose whole article in memory,
	write it all at once, using the right name for the first group.
	insist on reading from disk? probably not.
