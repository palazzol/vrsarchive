INEWS. We have
the technology
today to bring 'em
back tomorrow.

    By the 1990s, fighter pilots will need an inte-
grated electronic warfare suite that fuses the
capabilities of multiple warning and response sys-
tems. Advanced technology that provides complete
protection with greater reliability. That system is the
Integrated Electronic Warfare System - INEWS.
    The TRW/Westinghouse Joint Venture is the
only team that offers such a powerful combination
of advanced technologies and specific, long-term
experience for INEWS.
    Our Phase I and II VHSIC contracts, together
with our VHSIC 1750A program, will increase pro-
cessing speed and memory and reduce space and
power demands. Our wideband microwave trans-
mitters and receivers can make functional integra-
tion a cost-effective, operational reality. Our detector
technologies ensure instant warning of all fore-
seeable threats. And our expendables technology
provides a wide range of threat-response options.
