This is an alpha test release.  Do not distribute modified copies of it;
see the COPYRIGHT file for details.

Send bug reports to utzoo!cnews-alpha.  This software is believed to
work, though it could doubtless stand some improvement.  The code is
going to be cleaned up and possibly sped up before general release.

Does your inews wallow in the mud like a pregnant sow? Does your expire
flop on its back, wiggle its feet and gurgle pathetically?  Then you
need new, improved *C news*, the sentient being's news system: no more
odious Relay-Version headers, no more sluggish machines caused by
overfed news software.  Real locking.  No line-eater bugs.

Available from fine news administrators everywhere.  C news.
___

Assumptions:
	you already have B news and possibly rn running
	you personally installed B news
	you are now upgrading to C news

Before using make for anything else, you must

	make variant

where variant is your UNIX variant: v7, v8, v9, bsd42 or usg.
It will tell you to edit the makefile DEPSRC and DEPOBJ definitions to match.

If you need a roadmap, see ../usr.lib/README.

../expire and ../time require that /usr/include/time.h exists.
If it doesn't exist on your (4.2BSD) system, thanks to gratuitous
tinkering (at UCB), execute

	cd /usr/include; ln -s sys/time.h

This may require super-user privileges, which should be easy to obtain
on 4.2.

After compiling inews, install it as /usr/lib/news/realinews,
setuid-news.  On older systems, you will to also install a small
program, setnewids, setuid-root.  If this worries you, read
setnewsids.c; all it does is execute setgid(), setuid() to the "news"
group and user if they exist, otherwise realinews's real ids. Install
sh/inews as /usr/bin/inews, rnews.sh as /usr/bin/rnews and
/usr/bin/cunbatch.  You can test realinews by giving NEWSCTL, NEWSBIN
or NEWSARTS environment variables to change the library, binary or
spool directories and I encourage this.

If you plan to run rn, you'll need the latest rn patches to allow Xref:
to work without Relay-Version:.

You can get postnews from B news & Pnews from rn.

Your sys file should not refer to a given batch file (with the F or f
flags) more than once, or the batch file will be scrambled; this will be
fixed and isn't a disaster as the C batcher is quite flexible and can
compensate.  The Ln flag isn't yet fully implemented.

If your `domain' isn't "uucp", you will need to put your domain name in
/usr/lib/news/domain.  No upper case letters in your new domain please,
there is no call for it and it just looks ugly.

You must remove /usr/lib/news/LOCK* and /usr/lib/news/lock.* somewhere
in /etc/rc*.  Thus you must only permit rnews to run on file servers.

You'll need compress for compressing or uncompressing batches of news.
See the contact person of your news feed or the moderator of the
newsgroup comp.sources.unix.

See the anews directory for conversion filters from A to B and back.

You'll need to install /usr/lib/news/gngp (see ../gngp) before inews
will work.

B-2.11-isms: your /usr/lib/news/mailpaths file must be updated to point
at your nearest backbone site.  A 5th sys file field for Distribution:
patterns is here (add them in sys after the subscription list, separated
by "/"), and a 6th field for excluded hosts is half-here, separated by
"/" from the system name.  Active file support for 4 fields and the m
flag are here.

Good Luck.

	Geoff Collyer
