[ Approximate wording ]  My new one is 15% faster than DMR's on
/usr/dict/words and 68% faster on /etc/passwd.  Uglix has some of the
same improvements.

These are faster versions of fputs, fread and fwrite. Unlike my fgets,
these are much faster than Dennis's and are still public-domain and
plug-compatible. I haven't bothered measuring fputs, but I did three
timing trials using fread and fwrite to copy 195k from stdin to stdout
each time, using fread and fwrite buffers of 8 bytes, 512 bytes and
16,384 bytes.  Again on a 4.2 750, my fread/fwrite were respectively
1.67, 21.63 and 23.77 times faster than Dennis's.

Comments?
