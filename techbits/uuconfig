The UUCP software, while very useful, has been underused in the past because
it is not easy to configure.  This paper reviews the functions of the UUCP
software and presents a tool developed to assist the user in configuring a
UUCP network.

.NH 1
What is UUCP?
.PP
The UUCP software provided with Intel XENIX provides communication services
between an Intel XENIX system and another system.  The only requirements
are an ASCII communication line and that both systems have UUCP software.
The UUCP system provides three basic functions:
.SH
File Transfer
.PP
The simplest function of the UUCP software is file transfer.  The UUCP
software provides the user with the ability to transfer files from one
system to another, with suitable checks to prevent unauthorized transfers.  
.SH
Remote Execution
.PP
One of the most used features of UUCP is the ability to request that a
system execute commands on your behalf.  The most popular application of
this ability is electronic mail.  XENIX provides a  program which is capable
of displaying and transmitting mail to users of a system.  To send mail
between systems, the sending system generates a request that the mailer
on the receiving machine be executed to deliver the mail.
.SH
Terminal Emulation
.PP
Also included with the UUCP software is the `cu' utility, which allows a
user to use a terminal on one system to access another.  The user terminal
appears as if it is connected to the remote system.  In addition, special
requests are supported to transfer data over the connection.
.NH 1
What have been the problems with UUCP?
.PP
The problem with UUCP has been one of configuration.  The table below shows
the configuration files and maintenance programs used by the UUCP system
distributed with Release 3.0 of XENIX:
.TS
box;
c | c
l | l.
File Name	Function
=
/etc/systemid	Network node name
/usr/bin/uulog	Network log maintenance
/usr/lib/uucp/L-devices	Devices for use by UUCP
/usr/lib/uucp/L-dialcodes	Dialer Abbreviations
/usr/lib/uucp/L.sys	Connection Database
/usr/lib/uucp/USERFILE	File permission database
/usr/lib/uucp/dial	Program to handler auto-dialers

.PP
The functions and syntax of these files and utilities have been poorly
understood.  To illustrate the issues involved, let us examine for a
moment the file \fB/usr/lib/uucp/USERFILE\fR.  This file controls the set
of files a user is allowed to send or receive from a remote system, and
consists of lines of the form
.nf
.sp
	\fIuser\fR, \fIsystem\fR \fIdirectory\fR...
.sp
.fi
.PP
The basic idea is that the user named \fIuser\fR on system \fIsystem\fR may
transfer files to or from only the directories listed.  However, either
\fIuser\fR or \fIsystem\fR may be null, and four prioritized rules are used
to specify the behavior in a specific case.
.PP
Although the rules are sensible and flexible, the number of rules for each
of the files in the table above add up to show that the task of configuring
UUCP can become formidable.
.PP
Another problem reported occasionally was that the list of programs which may
be executed remotely (using the uux utility) is not configurable.  As a result,
if there is a need to execute a program other than electronic mail, there is
no way to tell the UUCP system to permit this.
.NH 1
Solutions
.PP
Solutions to the above problems will come in two parts.  The first part is a
tool to configure existing functionality in the UUCP system.  This tool also
contains code to support the second part, which is an enhanced UUCP system
that provides configurable uux permission lists.
.NH 2
The UUCP Configuration Tool
.PP
A new tool has been developed by XENIX Applications Marketing which simplifies
the installation and modification of the UUCP system by handling the details
of the configuration.  It presents a user interface based on the configuration
task at hand rather than the content of a particular configuration file.
.PP
UUCP Configuration breaks down naturally into a small set of activities.
A working UUCP network requires a set of machines, each with a unique name
within the network.  These machines communicate over communication links
which come in two basic flavors -- direct connections and phone connections.
Direct connections are implemented by dedicating a communications port on
each machine involved in a link and running a cable between them.  Modem
connections are implemented by using an auto-dial modem on one system and
an auto-answer modem on the other.  Since the XENIX system does not come
configured for modems, modem lines must be set up specially before they
can be used by UUCP.  UUCP also maintains a database of abbreviations for
common phone number prefixes.  The most common use of this is to set up
a prefix to get an outside line or a long distance area code.  Once lines
are set up, each system must be informed of the connections in which it
is involved, and each connection carries a set of permission and login
information.
.PP
The UUCP configuration program presents a menu asking what task the user
wishes to perform.  The tasks it can perform are 1) set the name by which
the system is known to the UUCP network, 2) set up and remove modems which
may then be used by UUCP to connect to other systems or permit other systems
(or users) to call your system, 3) manipulate dialer abbreviations which are
used to record site dependent dialing information, 4) manipulate UUCP
connections to other systems, and 5) edit the list of programs which may be
executed on your system by users of other systems.  This last requires the
configurable uux described below.
.NH 2
Enhanced UUCP Software
.PP
The next release of XENIX will include UUCP enhancements which will include
the ability to configure the list of commands the uux utility will allow a
user of one machine to execute on another.  This list is currently set to
include \fBrmail\fR, \fBrnews\fR, and \fBruusend\fR, and is not configurable
by the system administrator.  In addition, the new UUCP software will provide
the ability to initiate a connection immediately in response to a user's uux
or uucp request.  Since many system administrators would rather spool the
days work and perform network transfers during low usage times, the
desirability of immediate connection is a matter of taste.  The current
release does not do immediate connections, where previous releases did.  In
the next release, the system administrator will be allowed to make the choice.
.NH 1
Summary
.PP
The file transfer, remote execution, and terminal emulation capabilities of
the UUCP software are becoming more accessible as it becomes more
configurable and easier to configure.  Problems caused by the large numbers
or poorly understood configuration files have been solved by a tool available
from your XENIX Software Specialist, so that the power of the UUCP system
need not lie dormant.
