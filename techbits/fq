MARKETING
.NH 2
Are there any plans to develop a high quality presentation on XENIX suitable
for new prospects?
.IP
.NH 2
Is there any way we can get a marketing presentation on how to identify the
Commercial OEM prospect?  We are still too driven by what works/doesn't and
other post-sales concerns.  Show us how to recognize and close XENIX OEMs and
their applications.
.IP
.NH 2
The Unix users group /usr/group has published a proposal for a system call
standard.  Do we have any plans relative to this standard?
.IP
The current Release 3 system calls follow the System III standard and
Release 5 (the next release) will follow the System V standard.
As the UNIX/XENIX community standardizes more and more of the system call
interface we will continue to use the standards in the marketplace.
.NH 2
A great deal of useful information appears in publications and Unix/XENIX user
groups such as USENIX and /usr/group.  Is there any way we could get the
relevant material from such publications distributed to the Intel field force?
.IP
We are unable to distribute articles that appear in publications because
of copyright problems.  However, we will point you to these articles
as best we can with tech-bits, FAE training material, etc.
.NH 2
When can we expect to see job control in XENIX?
.IP
There are no plans to implement job control for XENIX at this time.
.NH 2
When can I expect to see XENIX capable of doing real time?  I hear over and
over from customers who seem to want a real time XENIX.
.IP
Rather than attempt to make XENIX do real time, a better approach would be
to develop XENIX as a front end for development of real time applications
which run on a real time system (RMX).  This is the basic architecture for
RMX 386.
.NH 2
Will we ever own C Compiler source in the future?  As long as we don't have
that source, we seem to be at the mercy of Microsoft schedules (which will
probably favor IBM) for bug fixes.
.IP
We do not currently have plans to acquire C compiler source for XENIX-286.
However, Microsoft is steadily improving the C compiler, and we will 
continue to fold the latest compiler technology from Microsoft into our product.
We will own source to the 386 C compiler.
.NH 2
Where can I get a new list of available ISV software?  The last one I got is
rather old.
.IP
Maurice Voce (ISO, Deer Valley) is the product manager for ISV software.  
He should be able to get you a current list.
.NH 2
My customers have trouble getting a hold of ISV software (even the GOLD
packages).  How can they get this software?
.IP
Availability issues should also be directed to Maurice Voce.
.NH 2
It seems like an electronic bulletin board or similar communication mechanism
could ultimately mean more system sales.  Would this be possible?
.IP
There is general agreement that such a mechanism would be a great help.
Unfortunately, we are still researching technology to do this.  The crucial
problem is the security of such a system, since the information exchanged
would tend to be extremely sensitive.
.NH 1
COMPILERS AND UDI
.NH 2
Where can I get details about new language features in the Release 3 C
compiler?
.IP
The new features are fully described in a Tech-Bit entitled "New
Features of the Release 3 C Compiler" that published in the 3/15
edition of Tech-Bits.
.NH 2
When should we expect Huge Model C?
.IP
Huge Model will be included in Release 5.  If available sooner, it
will be released in an Update 3 or 4.
.NH 2
How many text segments are allowed in Middle/Large/Huge Model?  How many data
segments are allowed in Large/Huge Model?
.IP
In Release 3 of Xenix, a program must load with 147 total segments or less.
At least one of these must be a data segment.  Therefore, the total
number of text segments in Middle, Large and Huge model is 146.  With
Update 1 of Release 3 the LDT can dynamically expand.  This means that
once running, a program can dynamically ask for more memory and the
number of data segments can increase.  Programs cannot dynamically ask
for more text space, so 146 text segments (9 megabytes) is the limit.
.NH 2
How are UDI languages for XENIX being packaged?
.IP
DSO will release four products for XENIX in late May.  They will
be an ASM product, including the assembler, and R & L tools, a PLM
product, including the PLM compiler and libraries, a Fortran product,
including the Fortran compiler and libraries and a PSCOPE product.
.NH 2
Does XENIX PSCOPE-286 work with the Microsoft Compilers, and if so how well
does it handle the Microsoft symbol table format?
.IP
.NH 2
Is it possible for multiple users to run XENIX PSCOPE-286 simultaneously
on different programs?  I had heard that this was not possible.
.IP
It is possible for multiple users to run PSCOPE.  The only
restriction is that you may not run PSCOPE on a program which is already
being debugged or currently executing.  This is also a restriction of `adb',
the debugger that is supplied with XENIX.
.NH 2
Does AEDIT run under XENIX and if so, how do we get it?
.IP
AEDIT has been completed for XENIX.  However, DSO has no
plans to productize it at this time.
.NH 1
DRIVERS
.NH 2
Does the new 544 driver do block input transfers for higher performance with
UUCP or MICNET?
.IP
The 544 device driver is written so that all available characters are read from
the board when an input interrupt is acknowledged.  The 544 board will generate
input interrupts for every character, but if more characters become available
before the interrupt is acknowledged the additional characters are read as
well.
.NH 2
Does the new 544 driver know about 19.2K baud?  Is there a getty option to
enable a line at 19.2K baud?
.IP
Yes, the driver supports 19.2k baud.  Use getty option 8.  You should be
aware that some terminals have been seen which advertise 19.2K baud but
which drop characters at that speed.
.NH 2
In Release 1 there was a problem with running the console port at a speed
other than 9600 baud.  At boot time the monitor initializes the console port
to the correct rate.  Xenix should use this rate until the system goes
multi-user and getty is run.  Was this fixed in Release 3?
.IP
The baud rate is initialized in a kernel routine which is shared among all
terminal devices.  Simply removing this initialization would cause other
terminal ports to fail to initialize baud rates.  A solution that would work
for other terminals as well as for the special case of the console is not
currently planned.
.NH 1
KERNEL AND FILE-SYSTEM
.NH 2
Will there be a `scrunch' type utility to compress the free space in the
bit map to be contiguous?
.IP
There are no plans for such a utility.  The performance gains from such a
utilty are not expected to be signifigant, and such a utility places the
integrity of files whose data is being moved at risk due to bad blocks,
crashes while the utility is running, etc.
.NH 2
Since the new file system now relies for consistency on a number of Cylinder
Group Blocks as well as the Super Block, does this pose a greater problem
with file-system inconsistency after crashes?
.IP
No.  The primary function of the Cylinder Group Blocks is to hold the
bitmap which contains the free list.  The free list was held before in
the superblock.  The superblock is the block of the filesystem most likely
to be out of date.  The free list is thus no more likely to be invalid
than it was in the old file system.  The free list is also no more difficult
to rebuild, so everything is as reliable as before with better performance.
.NH 2
There exists a problem installing XENIX on systems with more than 1 MB
of memory.  When will this be cleaned up?
.IP
This limit will be increased to 2MB in Update 3 and fixed entirely in
the next release (release 5).  As a current workaround on systems
with winchesters greater than 20MB, boot the
system with less than 1MB of memory, modify the `swap' variable
in /sys/conf/xenixconf to be 4104 and generate a new kernel. Systems
with disks less than 20MB should not use more than 1MB of memory.
To do so requires reformatting the disk.
.NH 2
When will XENIX 286 have virtual memory?
.IP
XENIX 286 will do swapping a segment at a time in Release 5.  XENIX 386 will
be based on a paging scheme.
.NH 1
CONFIGURATION AND INSTALLATION
.NH 2
The 215 driver will support multiple drives.  Will there be a c215g.c for
P-box configurations?  How will multi-winchester configurations be handled
during installation?
.IP
Installation is the same as for systems with one winchester.  After XENIX
is installed a configuration utility which ships with the P-box is used to
configure in any additional drives.  This configuration utility understands
the configurations possible with the 215 board and will be enhanced
and included in Release 5.
.NH 2
The format command in Release 1 would not write bad block information to
create the bad block table on the disk when it was missing.  Will the format
command in Release 3 do this?
.IP
The format command does not currently do this.  Since winchesters on Intel
systems ship with the bad block information already on the winchester, this
fell below the ZBB for Release 3.  The SDT utilities shipped with every
system will place bad block information on the winchester if necessary.
A utility will be provided in Release 5 which will provide a graceful
method of dealing with defective areas of a disk.
.NH 2
Some of our customers will want to partition their disks and run both XENIX
and MS-DOS.  How will they get a new c215g.c and installation software for
their changed disk configuration?
.IP
Update 3 will include the changes to XENIX to allow configuration of an
MS-DOS partition at installation time.  Temporary solutions have appeared
in TECHBITS for the 310-17 and 310-40/41.  These solutions are available
from ISO.
.NH 2
Is there any way to set up a system with the winchester split between RMX and
XENIX using a scheme like the one for MS-DOS?
.IP
Such a split is certainly possible.  To set up such a system, the RMX boot
loader would need to be modified to allow booting RMX from the winchester.
Unfortunately, such a boot loader is not available.
MS-DOS is used in split winchester configurations because it provides
compatibility with personal computers and their software.
Since only one of XENIX or RMX could be active at a time and cross development
software is not available, such a system does not appear to be an attractive
solution at this time.
.NH 2
There are no hub rings on the release diskettes.  This makes them suceptible
to damage by careless insertion in the floppy drive.  Would it be possible
to use hub rings on these diskettes?
.IP
We are always looking for ways to improve the quality of our product.
Currently we have a large inventory of diskettes in manufacturing without
hub rings.  If we sell out of these, and software bookings indicate that
a high volume diskette purchase is in order, we may be able to order
diskettes with hub rings without additional expense.
.NH 2
Floppy read errors were not recovered from well in the Release 1 
installation process. Often the effect of the error was not known, 
causing users to restart the installation (to be safe).  
Does the installation procedure in Release 3
cope more gracefully with I/O errors during installation?
.IP
Yes.  The Release 3 installation procedure is not concerned 
about which particular diskette is currently being read.  Rather it
prompts for a new disk and reads it, and continues to prompt until
the user tells it to stop.  If an error is encountered on a particular
diskette, another attempt can be made to read that diskette before
continuing on.  Errors are often a result of an alignment problem so
removing and reinserting the diskette will probably allow it to
be re-read.
.NH 2
Will there be any way to configure uux in Release 3?  Customers expect this
and it dents the credibility of the Open Systems message to be unable to
configure uux.
.IP
.NH 2
Would it be possible to derive a document describing the questions to ask
regarding configuration of XENIX for specific applications?
.IP
.NH 1
MANUALS AND DOCUMENTATION
.NH 2
Is there any way to get on-line manuals into Release 3?  They are a demo tool
that is responded to well by potential customers.
.IP
Not in the near future.  On-line manuals were not included in Release 3
for two reasons.  One, the format of the manuals was changed to put
commands that perform similar functions into manuals describing that
function, rather than including all commands in one manual section.
The on-line manuals expected the previous manual format.  Second,
substantial changes and improvements have been made to the manual pages.
The time and manpower required to make these changes to existing software
would have pushed the release date of the operating system out to an 
unacceptable level.
.NH 2
Could the manuals be made to highligt in grey (or by some such technique)
differences between Intel XENIX and Microsoft Xenix?
.IP
We have suggested this to the Technical Publications people.
.NH 2
Will there be documentation available in the manual or elsewhere to clarify
how to develop code wich is compatible with System 5 (i.e., will be compatible
with Release 5)?
.IP
There was a tech-bit entitled "Intel Release 3 and Unix System 5:
Competitive Analysis" published in the 7/13/84 issue of Tech-Bits which
described the differences between the two operating systems.  If
functionality which is only supplied in Xenix is not used, most
compatability problems will be solved.
.NH 2
Where can I find more information about the Visual Shell?
.IP
The new documentation contains a manual entitled "Xenix-286
Visual Shell User's Guide" which describes the visual shell
in detail.
.NH 2
Is there any way to get the learn scripts on Release 3?  They make an effective
demonstration tool to customers.
.IP
Currently there are no plans to provide the learn scripts.  They
require a large amount of disk space and have become somewhat
outdated.
.NH 2
Will the `dial' program for UUCP be adequately documented?  Customers may need
to write one to work on another type of modem.
.IP
The new documentation provides a manual entitled "XENIX-286 Communications
Guide".  This provides a description of how dial is used as well as
providing complete source of the current dial program.
.NH 1
PRINTERS
.IP
.NH 2
I understand that our line printer software is much better than the Microsoft
software.  What is better?
.IP
XENIX from Microsoft provides the same line printer support as our 
Release 1 did.  Either
a single parallel or serial printer can be used.  Setting up a serial printer 
required a special program and some understanding of terminal devices.
Release 3  is based on the Berkeley line printer software.  This allows
multiple printers and print queues.  It also provides the capability
of running both parallel and serial printers and has an easy mechanism
for configuring the printer ports as well as determining which printer
to send output to.
.NH 2
There is currently no nroff description table for the Intel printer.  Will this
be fixed in Release 3?
.IP
Not in the near future.
.NH 2
There is currently no way to generate nroff description tables for new
printers.  Will such a facility be available in Release 3?
.IP
Not in the near future.
.NH 2
Will typesetters really be supported in Release 3 and if so, how?
.IP
Release 3 contains the software necessary to generate output that
will be recognized by a C.A.T. phototypesetter.  It does not contain
a C.A.T. phototypsetter device driver.  A Multibus board and driver
would be required to actually generate phototypsetter output.  If
another type of phototypsetter is desired, software which converts
C.A.T. output to a form recognized by the new typesetter is also 
required.
.NH 1
GENERAL
.NH 2
I see the 50K file size limit on vi as a serious limitation.  Is there any
hope of having the 50K limit removed?  Why does the limit exist in the first
place?
.IP
This has been fixed in Update 2.  The file size limit is now approximately
250K.  The fix is to change the stack size to allow more room for line
buffers.  If you do not have Update 2 yet, you can fix vi by using the 
command fixhdr as follows: fixhdr -F 2000 /bin/vi.
.NH 2
Will uuencode and uudecode (or the equivalent) be provided in Release 3?  There
is currently no way to transfer non-ASCII data by electronic mail.
.IP
Uuencode and uudecode will not be part of Release 3.  Non-ASCII data
can be sent using the uuto and uupick commands of the uucp software.
See the XENIX Communications Guide for more details.
.NH 2
System 5 packages the public domain news software with the product.  Any hope
of getting this software into an update?
.IP
There are no plans to include this software in the XENIX product.  However,
since it is public domain software, you should be able to get a copy
from any site currently running the `news' software.
.NH 2
System 5 has a set of fast memory manipulation routines.  These routines are
easy to implement on the 286.  Any hope of getting them into an update?
.IP
.NH 2
I seem to be able to manipulate existing MS-DOS media in Release 3, but not
to be able to create them.  How would I go about creating an MS-DOS diskette
on a XENIX system?
.IP
Currently, this is not possible.  You must format your diskettes using
an MS-DOS system before it can be used by XENIX systems.
.NH 2
Will I be able to read diskettes created on an IBM system on my XENIX system?
.IP
Yes, diskettes can be created on IBM systems using the double sided,
double density, 48tpi, 9 sectors/track device, that are
readable on Intel 310's.  Diskettes created on 310's can be read
onto an IBM system using this same device.  The only restriction is that
the diskettes must not contain file-systems (i.e. be mountable diskettes).
Other types of file creation utilities for diskettes like `tar' and `dd'
work fine.
.NH 2
The processing of phone and room numbers by the finger utility was specific
to Berkeley sites in Release 1.  Has this been fixed in Release 3?
.IP
Yes, this has been fixed.
.NH 2
What priority does the MICNET networking software run at, and can I change
this priority?
.IP
The MICNET software runs at the same default priority as other processes
on the system.  The initial priority can be changed using the `nice'
command.
