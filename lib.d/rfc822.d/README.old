I tried to fully understand it, but .......

Sending BSMTP is not the problem. Receiving is the dificult part.

Very similar to my situation !

Sure, see below. Please feel invited to send comments and suggestions.
If you go ahead with a BSMTP server please let me know. If there are
code conversion problems I could send it in tarmail format.

This is an RFC822 addressparser. The grammer and scanner are based on work
done by Bill Nesheim of Cornell:

I have generalized it to accept -hopefully- full RFC822 syntax and store
the pieces in a reasonable datastructure for processing. The rationale for
this is not to do any string shoving in the mailer proper. I have had to
understand too much Mail software that munged address strings in too many
places.

However I haven't written a program using this parser yet because I have
little time for this 'hobby'.

One thing it doesn't handle very well are ()-comments. Since they are
essentially white space, they are skipped by the scanner. If there is
more than one of this kind in any given address, they will be concatenated
in the adderss structure. This makes it impossible to reconstruct a
commented address string from the parsed version exactly.

There is a program to test the parser: tparse.c

It has been run on VAX, NS32016 and 68000 CPUs.

Pleas feel invited to send comments, suggestions and fixes!
