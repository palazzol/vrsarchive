These files make up a YACC grammar for parsing RFC822 addresses which
I received a long time ago from

They kind of hung around a long time gathering mold until someone posted
a request for a LEX parser for RFC822.  Well, I mentioned this thing
and the responses just took off.  Rich Salz contributed a few changes.
(mainly, it seems, improving portability).  For my part, I've gone
over the grammar with a fine-tooth comb to check if it matches the spec.
The results of that are in NOTES.

	Here's my changes, basically, a rewrite.  Do what you will -- I suppose my
	name should go in there, in case I put in any bugs...

One thing this stuff doesn't do is parse a whole message. (or even
just the headers).  It only parses addresses.  It should be simple
enough to wrap a header-parser around this address-parser, probably
in the same grammar.

I personally am slightly displeased that it will group all the comment
text into one thing.  That's not a very nice thing to do, and shouldn't
really be necessary ...  But it's sat here long enough without my doing
anything with it ... :-)
