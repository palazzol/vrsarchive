The directory routines are in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.  They are a completely
rewritten version of code first made available by the University of
California at Berkeley.  Berkeley considered this a transition aid to
help convert programs to use the new 4.2BSD directory structure
(255-character file names, etc.).  It is more generally useful than
that, however, as UNIX has long lacked a sensible interface for dealing
with directories.  This implementation is provided as a public service
to help UNIX sites produce more portable source code, since this interface
can now be made available on all UNIX systems, not just those from Berkeley.

Please do not change the interface, as that defeats the whole purpose
of this package!
