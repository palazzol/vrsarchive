			DPY (release 2)

The DPY module was originally written for a 4.2 BSD UNIX system running on a
VAX 750.  It now also runs under System V.  There are two makefiles supplied
with this release, with the following names:

	makefile.bsd	for 4.2 BSD.
	makefile.usg	for System V.

You should copy the appropriate makefile to the file "makefile" in order to
build the library that is suitable for your system.

This is the second release of the DPY module.  There have been some changes
in some of the dpy routines since the previous release.  If you have any
programs written for the previous release, you will need to modify them
as follows in order to use the new DPY:

	Dpyclearline is now called dpyclrline.
	Dpyclearwindow is now called dpyclrwindow.
	Dpyinit is called with different arguments.

The file dpy.doc describes the new calling formats.  These changes were made
in order to make DPY less system dependent.  There are also several bug fixes
in this new release.

If you are running under a different machine, you have to change the makefile
to use gensubs.c instead of vaxsubs.s (this contains generic subroutines which
run on all machines).  If you are ambitious, you can speed up dpy by writing
your own assembly level routines to duplicate what gensubs.c does.  Not much
assembly code is needed.  (If you are real lucky, you are on a 32016, and the
necessary routines are already written in ns32ksubs.s.)  I am willing to
collect and distribute such subroutines for some other machines.

I have included two toy programs (test1.c and test2.c) which demonstrate some
of the capabilities of dpy.  Along with dpy.doc, they should show you how to
use the module.  I am still sorry that dpy.doc is not formatted.  Someday...

Comments and bug fixes are welcome.
