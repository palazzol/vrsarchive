These routines implement the portable directory access interface
introduced in 4.2BSD.  They are in the public domain.

Programs that need to read directories must be changed to use these
directory access routines (see also ../include/dir.h), which should
be bundled into the standard system C library for convenience.

/usr/include/sys/dir.h should be removed to encourage conversion.
