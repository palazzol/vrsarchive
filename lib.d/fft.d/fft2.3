.sh NAME
fft2 - perform forward or inverse Fast Fourier Transform, length 2**n
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd fft2
(a, b, m, dx, inverse)

float a[];

float dx;

int inverse;
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it fft2
is a function which forward transforms time series real data to 
frequency spectrum complex data, or the inverse, where the length
of the data is a power of 2.  Two references were utilized in the
writing of
.it fft2

The algorithm is decimation in time with reverse binary permutation
prior to the butterfly steps.  No advantage is taken of trigonometric
function values of -1, 0, and 1.  The trigonometric function values
are calculated using the second difference technique.

Parameter descriptions:
.s1
.lp 16 9
a       is the input and output array of real values, time series
for forward transform, and frequency for inverse transform.
.s1
.lp 16 9
b       is the input and output array of imaginary values, set to
zero by
.it fft2
for forward transform, frequency for inverse transform.
.s1
.lp 16 9
m       is the log (base 2) of half the length of a and b.
.s1
.lp 16 9
dx      is the time between samples in the time series, for
.bd either
forward or inverse transforms.
.s1
.lp 16 9
inverse is true for an inverse transform, false for forward.
