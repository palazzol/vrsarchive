	The source that follows is a reverse assembler for C Power (tm)
C compiler object files.  It represents my first attempt at programming
in C and is probably full of inconsistencies and other code which might
be noxious to seasoned C programmers.  I would be greatful for comments
and suggestions, especially from other owners of C power, with regard to
enhancing or otherwise improving this program.  One minor point in its
favor is that it works.  I downloaded this without benefit of Xmodem or
Kermit so there may be a garble or two, though I've screened the source
here very carefully.  Don't try to compile it on Unix - FILE is defined
as int in C Power.  Hope this is of use to someone.
