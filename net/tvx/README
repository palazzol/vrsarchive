	This is a mature, well debugged editor.  Unlike emacs, it
is a two mode editor (like vi).  Recent surveys indicate that about
40% of users prefer a two mode editor.  This code contains ifdefs
for 4.2 BSD Unix (on Vaxen and Suns), IBM-PC DOS, Generic MS-DOS,
CP/M-80, and the Atari 520ST.  It should be trivial to port it to
other systems with real C compilers.  It has never been tried on
little systems like 6502's.

	I would like to act as a central clearing house for bug
reports - I will fix all bugs I hear about.  I will post major
bugs to net.sources.bugs as I get reports.

	I would like to hear about new implementations and
possible extensions.  I don't want to hear any complaints about the
design or code.  This is an evolved editor, and if I were to start
from scratch, there would be things different - but...  I think
this will compare favorably with any public domain available.

	All postings are in shar format and contain directions for
splitting the files.

	Disclaimer: This editor has been used most heavily at UNM,
Sandia National Laboratories, and Los Alamos National Laboratories. 
It was originally designed in 1979, so the command set and user
interface are well debugged.  It is possible that there are some
code bugs, and that the TERMCAP version will not work on ALL terminals,
but it works on most. The SUN version still needs an interrupt
handle to be completely dynamic in windows - but the '(' command
will re-size the windows manually.  The University of New Mexico
has not had any part in the development of the editor.  It is
posted as is - there are no warranties of any kind with the editor.
