The following, a response to my grammar of the Klingonese language, is
a guide to Elvish.  It was compiled by Robert M. Schroeck of Princeton
University, reachable on Bitnet as rms@puccuts.BITNET (via your friendly
Bitnet gateway, probably ucbvax/Berkeley).

Pointers to this appeared in the net.sf-lovers and net.nlang groups.

To those of you in ARPA-land receiving this under UNIX-SOURCES, oh well.
That's what you get for receiving a Usenet newsgroup intended for anything
too large for normal groups.  Pass it on to those on the SF-LOVERS list.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Okay, you can do a lot more with Elvish than you can with
klingonaase because Tolkien left a much larger vocabulary with
which to work -- still, it's kind of small -- 600 words more or
less.  However, there's evidence that, like in German, you can
hook small words together to make bigger words that represent
other things.  Most of what's in here is generalization from what
is left of the tongues, but it seems to work well enough.
     First thing to remember is that there are two Elvish languages
extant:	 Sindarin (Grey-elvish) and Quenya (High-elvish).  They
can be used in compound forms and structures, but it is sometimes
confusing, not generally considered good usage, except in names
and other nouns.  Everything here will be labeled as to source
language.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
			   VERBS
			  (Quenya)
Present	    Past       Future	       Imperative      subjunctive
root + a    root + e   root + uva      root + e	       root + ai
na = is	    ne = was   nuva = will be  ne! = be!       nai = may it be
sila =	    sile =     siluva = will   sile! =	       sulai = may it
  shines      shone	  shine		 shine!		 shine

		The plural is formed by adding "r".  When
	    the subject is plural, the verb must be, also:
	    lassi lantar = leaves fall
		To indicate the pronouns  I, we, and thou
	    as subjects, the following suffixes are added:
	    -n for I, -(l)met for we, and -lye for thou.
	    In the case of -met, the l may take the place
	    of the plural r:  lantalmet = we fall

			(Sindarin)
Present	   Past	       Future	    Imperative	 Participial   Auxiliary
root + a   root + ant  root + ath   root + o	 root + iel    root + i
na = is	   nant = was  nath = will  no! = be!	 niel = being  ni = have
			  be					 been
edra =	   edrant =    edrayh =	    edro! =	 edriel =      edri = have
   open	      opened	  will open    open!	    opening	 opened

	       To indicate the pronoun I is the subject, a
	    vowel and the letter n are added:

root + on  root + en   root + ath + on			       root + in
non = I	   nen = I     nathon =	 I			       nin = I
      am	 was	   will be				 have been

	       No other pronoun structures survive in either
	    language.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
				NOUNS
	  Compound nouns are constructed by placing the descriptive
     element before the main element, unlike English.  The concepts
     "of" and "of the" are expressed by word order:
	  Dunadan "Man of the West" literally "west-man"
	  Yavanna "Giver of Fruits" literally "fruit-gift"

	  It is permissable to combine Quenya and Sindarin elements.
     Tolkien said "Boromir" was such a combination.

	  Quenya plural is formed by adding "i" to words ending in
     one or more consonants, "r" to words ending in vowels:
     elen -> eleni, sinda -> sindar, las -> lassi, alda -> aldar.
	  Possessive in Quenya is formed by dropping the final vowel,
     if there is one, and adding "o" for singular forms.  For plurals,
     add -on, and do not drop the vowel.  Varda -> Vardo "Varda's"
     Silmarilli -> Silmarillion "of the Silmarils".
	  Prepositional elements come at the end of Quenya words, but
     the final vowel is not dropped:  Oiolosse -> Oiolosseo "from Ever-
     white", Lorien -> Loriendesse "in Lorien".
	  In Quenya, the dual element is formed by adding "t":	maryat
     "hands-her-two", met "us two".

	  Sindarin plurals are formed by changing the vowels, as shown
     below:
		 adan = man, edain = men
		 amon = hill, emyn = hills
		 annon = gate, ennyn = gates
		 barad = tower, beraid = towers
		 mallorn = gold-tree, mellyrn = gold-trees
		 orch = orc, yrch = orcs
		 orod = mountain, ered = mountains

	  Some of the rules covering these changes are:	 stressed a
     becomes e, unstressed a becomes ai, o becomes e, i, or y.

	  Collective plurals are formed in Sindarin by adding -ath
     or, usually in the case of peoples, -rim, literally meaning
     "a host", "a great number":  elenath "all the stars", Rohirrim
     "all the Masters of Horses".
	  An augmentive suffix, -on, is added to Sindarin nouns to
     signify that the thing is very great or mighty, as in aearon
     "great sea".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			      ARTICLES

	  The only article in Elvish is the Quenya word "i", meaning
     "the".  Indefinite articles in Quenya and all articles in Sin-
     darin are apparently implied by the structure of the sentence.
	  There exists what appears to be a compound form similar
     to the French du and au;  it is the word "mi", translated by
     Tolkien as "in the".  It is assumed to be a combined form
     incorporating the pronoun i.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
			      SYNTAX
Acceptable structures are:
			      Quenya
subject-verb-object		    object-verb-subject
hisie untopa Calaciryo miri	    tier undulave lumbule
mist covers Calacirya's jewels	    roads drowned (by) heavy shadow

	       object-subject-verb
	       maryat Elentari ortane . . .
	       her two hands Star-Queen lifted up . . .

       Verbs occur at the end of sentences only in questions.
	   Si man i yulma nin enquantuva?
	   Now who the cup for me will refill?

       Sentences beginning with verbs tend to be emotionally charged:
	   Auta i lome!
	   Passing is the night!

       If there are one or more nouns before the verb, one of them will
    usually be the subject, unless it has a prepositional suffix (-o,
    -ello, -esse "from, "in"), in which case the subject is the noun
    following the verb.
	   Yeni ve linte yuldar avanier.
	   YEARS like swift draughts have passed away.
			 vs.
	   sindanoriello caita mornie i falmalinnar
	   from grey country lies DARKNESS the waves upon

       Most adjectives precede the noun; adjectives of plural nouns must
    be plural.	Adjectives are made plural by changing the final vowel to
    "e" or adding "e" if there is no final vowel.
       Two adjectives, or a possessive and an adjective, are never found
    in sequence, as in "the big blue ball" or "Joey's red truck".  The
    structure would be "the big ball blue" or "Joey's truck red".  Also,
    possessives are never placed between a preposition and its object:
	 Vardo nu luini tellumar    NOT	  nu Vardo luini tellumar
	 Varda's under blue domes	  under Varda's blue domes

       These are only guidelines -- in a highly inflected language such
    as Quenya, a great amount of freedom in word order is allowed.

				Sindarin
object-verb-subject		     verb-object
le linnathon			     na vedui Dunadan
(to) thee chant-I-will		     (it) is (at) last Dunadan
       (subject suffix)

verb-subject			     subject-verb-object
noro lim, Asfaloth!		     Naur dan i ngaurhoth!
ride on, Asfaloth!		     Fire take the werewolves!

	 Verbs are usually followed by their modifiers, which may
      even come at the end of a sentence:
	      Cuio i Pherian annan!
	      Live the Halflings long!

	 Nouns are usually followed by their modifiers.	 The concepts
      "of" and "of the" are usually implied by word order.  Where "from"
      or "of" is stated, the Sindarin word o stands alone, rather than
      as a suffix:
	      o menel,	    Celebrimbor o Eregion
	      from heaven,  Celebrimbor of Eregion
			    vs.
	      Annon edhellen
	      Door (of the) Elves

		   English to Elvish Dictionary

       Q = Quenya, S = Sindarin.  Verb roots are preceded by "to", as
       in "to abide".

       Accents are indicated by characters in the line above the word:
				/  .
			       yavie
       / = acute accent,    = circumflex,  and . = umlaut
       (two small dots over a vowel).

       A pronunciation key will be found at the end of the dictionary.

			 PRONUNCIATION KEY
	  The following pronunciation key is adapted from the
	  Appendix of The Silmarillion, Appendix E of The Lord
	  of The Rings, and Tolkien's updated notes from page
	  63 of The Road Goes Ever On.

   C   always has the value of K, never of S.  Celeb 'silver' is
       pronounced "keleb".
   CH  always has the value of CH in the Scottish 'loch' or Ger-
       man 'buch', never that in the English 'church'.

   DH  represents the voiced TH sound in 'the', not the unvoiced
       TH of 'thin'.  If you are pronouncing it right, you should
       feel a vibration in your larynx when you place your hand
       against it.  The voiced TH is found in such Elvish words
       as Maedhros, Caradhras, and Galadhrim.

   F   represents the F in 'find' except at the ends of words, as
       in the English 'of', where it has a V sound.  Note that the
       root nef- is spelled with a 'v' when used in the compound
       Nevrast 'Hither Shore'.

   G   is always "hard" G, as in 'get' or 'gild'.  'Gildor' begins
       as does 'Gilbert'; 'Region' begins as does 'regulate'.

   H   alone, uncombined with other consonants, has the value of H
       in 'house' and 'behold'.	 It has special values when com-
       bined as : CH, DH, LH, RH, TH, HW, and HY.  In Quenya, HT
       has the value of CHT in the German 'acht'.  This combination
       appears in 'Telumehtar'.

   I   in Sindarin, when occuring at the beginning of a word and
       followed by another vowel, has the value of consonantal Y:
       thus Ioreth is pronounced "Yoreth".

   K   is occasionally found in Elvish, and is the same as C.

   L   has approximately the sound of L in 'let'.  However, between
       E or I and a consonant, or after E or I at the end of a word,
       L was somewhat 'palatalized', that is, pronounced with the
       blade of the tongue, rather than the tip, against the hard
       palate, as in 'Eldar'.

   LH  represents an unvoiced, palatalized L.  In archaic Quenya,
       this was written HL.

   NG  has the value of NG in 'finger' except at the beginning and
       end of words, where it has the value of NG in 'sing', as in
       the Sindarin ngauroth 'werewolves'.

   QU  has the sound KW.

   PH  has the sound of F in find.

   R   is trilled in all positions.  RH, or HR as it is written in
       Quenya, represents a voiceless R.

   S   is always voiceless, as in 'so'.	 The sound Z as in 'is' and
       'zoo' did not occur in Elvish.

   TH  has the value of the voiceless TH in 'thin'

   TY  has the value of the British 'tune', not the American "toon".
       It has some of the quality of CH, as heard in some English
       dialect pronunciations of 'tune' as "chune", and also in the
       phrase 'at you', as "atcha" in some American dialects.

   V   has the value of the English V, not the German.

   W   has the value of the English W, not the German.	HW is a voice-
       less W, as in 'white' and 'whale'.

   Y   in Quenya is used for the consonant sound of Y in 'you'.	 In
       Sindarin, Y represented the modified U in the French 'lune'.
       HY represents a sound similar to that in 'hew' and 'huge', as
       in Hyarmen.  This sound is represented by the H in Quenya EHT
       and AHT.

       Consonants written twice are pronounced long.  The M in Rammas
       Echor and Sammath Naur have the sound of M in 'roommate' rather
       than that in 'ramming'.

   A   has the sound in 'father'.

   E   has the sound in 'bed' and is pronounced as a separate syllable
       in the middle of words such as Merethrond 'Feast Hall' and at the
			     / .				     .
       end of words such as lome 'dusk', where it is usually marked 'e'.

   I   has the sound in 'sick'.

   O   has the sound in 'hot', but "rounder" than in modern English,
       apparently with the mouth and lips held more open.
						  /
   U   has the sound in 'brute' even when long.	 Turin is pronounced
       'Toorin', not 'Tyoorin'.
							  /
       Long vowels were marked with an acute accent, e.g. a.  These
       vowels were long in duration rather having a different sound:
       not as in 'ape' but as in 'apple'.  However, in Quenya, long
       /     /
       e and o are correctly pronounced with a 'tenser and closer'
       sound than the short vowels, apparently with the mouth and
       lips more closed.  In Sindarin, stressed one-syllable words
       are marked with a circumflex accent, indicating a particularly
						    /
       prolonged vowel, as in dun, contrasted with Dunadan.

					  /
   AE and AI   have the sound of 'eye'.	 Dunedain ends with a syllable
	       pronounced 'dine'.

   EI	       has the sound in 'gray'.

   IE	       has the vowels sounded separately and run together as in
	       'Ni-enna'.  It does not have the sound in 'piece'.

   OE and OI   have the sound of the vowels in 'boy' and 'toy'.

   UI	       is pronounced as are the vowels in 'ruin', but run to-
	       gether into one syllable.

   AU and AW   have the sound in 'loud' and 'how'.  Sauron begins with
	       a syllable pronounced 'sour'.

   ER, IR, UR  before a consonant, as in Cirdan, or at the end of a
	       word, as in Ainur, shoud be pronounced as in English
	       AIR, EER, OOR.

   EA and EO   are not run together, but form separate syllables.


   STRESS.  In two-syllable words, the stress or accent is on the first
       syllable.  In longer words it occurs on the next to last
       syllable if that syllable contains a vowel followed by two or
       more consonants, a long vowel, or a dipthong (two vowels pronounced
       in one syllable, such as AI, EI).  IsILdur and PelARgir are
       words of this type.  If the next to the last syllable contains
       a short vowel followed by one or no consonants, the stress falls
       on the syllable before it, the third from the end.  FEanor,
       ErESsea, and DENethor are words of this type.  Digraphs, pairs
       of consonants that make a single sound, such as CH, DH, PH, SH
       and TH, are counted as one letter in determining stress, and are
       written with one letter in the Eldarin alphabets.
