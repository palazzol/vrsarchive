The files and context-diffs that follow can be applied to ditroff (dwb 1) to:
o	add lots of error checking

o	make the existing error messages more helpful

o	allow user-defined fonts

o	add some new facilities

o	add ``enhancements'' for compatibility with UCB-Gremlin

o	fix a lot of bugs

All of the changes are conditionally compiled with "ifdef" -- each set of
changes has its own name.

The resulting version of troff is *much* easier to use.

Caveat: the existing -ms and -mm macro packages are full of syntax errors and
bugs. These will start to produce warning messages.  If you fix them, the
output will be better.  Perhaps you'd like to post your fixes!

I shall be leaving Warwick to move to a new job at the end of this week, so
although mail will be forwarded (& I'd be glad of any changes that you needed
to make), I may take a while to respond!

Russell

This part contains the extra fles, local.c and local.h
