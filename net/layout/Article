This post appeares on hardware-related nets because of a recent debate
on how to build a system. So there might be someone out there interested
in a public domain printed circuit router. The source will appear on
net.sources only (in 10 parts, following this post).

PCB is an integrated router and editor to design printed circuits boards.
It adopts the 'correct by construction' principle, that is it will enforce
a certain set of design rules (such as cooper traces have to maintain a
minimal separation, holes have to be aligned etc). PCB maintains a data base
of the desired circuit to insure that signals of different net cannot be
shorted, to keep track of unfinished nets, to support the routers etc. 

PCB V1.24 features:
   * Interactive layout editing functions with on-the-fly design rule
     checking and enforcement.
   * Interactive placement functions.
   * Integrated routers that can be used interactively or automatically.
     (Completion rates of >90% were achieved on a board with about 1.9
     14 pin DIP chips / square inch)
   * Functions to move, shorten or straighten wires.
   * Supports the MOSIS process for 4 layer PC boards.
   * Update functions to allow changes to the circuit data base without
     re-routing the entire board.
   * Support for externally supplied geometry (such as connectors,
     text strings, logos etc).
   * Multiple wire widths.
   * Caltech Intermediate Form (CIF V2) output generator.
   * Versatec Plotter output for previews.

Required input files:
   * A list of device descriptions.
   * A list of used devices with optional placement information.
   * A net list of the desired circuit.

Required hardware:
   * A VAX running Unix 4.1 BSD
   * An unmodified AED-512 graphic terminal with a Bitpad-1 graphic
     tablet and a 4 key mouse.
   * (optional) A Versatec V-80 plotter

PCB is written in 'C' and it might be possible to port it to other
system configurations. It was successfully ported to 4.2 systems with
a different graphic hardware, however doing so requires some hacking.
A manual is included that gives some hints on how to port PCB.

The CIF output format is probably unpopular execpt for people with
MOSIS/Arpa connections. It is defined in the Mead & Conway book on
VLSI systems and PCB uses only a few constructs of it. In other words,
it should be easy to change the post-processor to produce other output
formats (I'm interested in any such code).

Please send me a message with your e-mail address if you use PCB.
This is because of curiousity and to have a way to send out bug-fixes.

PCB is a program to edit and route printed circuit boards, that was
posted to net.sources in August. Several bugs were discovered and
fixed. Also, several new features were added. These changes are
listed below.

The next post has the context diff's to patch the version of PCB
that was posted in August. If you got a copy of PCB via tape and
USmail, you will find that some fixes are already made in your copy.
In order to save space, the context diff's are compressed and
uuencoded. The complete, uncompressed update file is 117959 bytes
long.

The documentation to PCB is available as techreport CMU-CS-85-167 from:
    Carnegie-Mellon University
    Computer Science Dept.
    Schenley Park
    Pittsburgh, PA 15213
This may help sites that do not have Scribe to print the manual that
was included in the distribution.

In the unlikely event of new bugs ( :-) ), you can send a compressed version
of the most recent save-file (pcb.SAV) and the keystroke-file (Keys.sav)
that reproduces the problem. The ability to save and replay commands is one
of the new features. If I have some spare time, I might even look at those
bug reports...

   Happy patching  --  Andreas        arpa: agn@vlsi.cs.cmu.edu

Recent changes:

- 8/8/85  'exc_adel' in 'pmnrt.c' may not touch power or ground net.
-         Previously, an area-delete could couse the power/ground nets
-         to loose their done-status. This would cause the router to
-         work on them if an area route is executed.
- 8/21/85 'pnt_ha' in 'pmnrt.c' fixed: A diagonal wire approaching a
-         via-hole of the same net so that it just touches the corner
-         of the hole used to fail in some cases.
- 10/2/85 Cosmetic fix of the function call syntax for calls via
-         pointer. cc accepts 'pointer (args)' while the VMS C compiler
-         wants to see '(*pointer) (args)'.
- 10/8/85 The direct search for unplaced components in 'pfio.c' and
-         'pupdate.c' was broken. References to unplaced components
-         would fail.
- 10/18/85 Added check to catch memory allocation failures ('malloc'
-         returning a nil-pointer).
- 10/19/85 Netlist-update fixed: updating netlists occationaly failed, because
-         the loop that deletes old nets used the wrong termiation condition:
-         it usually went too far, which caused non-existing nets to be
-         deleted if the number of component holes is larger than 'nhmax'.
-         Also: fixed rounding error on board size info for plot preview.
-         Also: 'choose' no longer proposes empty nets ('selnet: ...' message)
-         Also: check in 'finish' added to avoid trouble if AED is not
-         accessable.
- 10/20/85 Key-stroke save facility added: when enabled via the diagnostic
-         menu, all mouse entries are save in the file 'Keys.sav'. This
-         sequence can be replayed. This feature helps to save work in
-         case of system crashes or to undo the last n commands. The
-         Keystroke file is reset whenever a save-command is executed so
-         that it keeps track of all changes from the most recently saved
-         image. This is also great to reproduce bugs.
- 10/23/85 'beep' was added to the component move function in case that a
-         move-inhibiting condition exists (cosmetic). A delay of one second
-         was added to prevent (error-) messages from being overwritten
-         too fast. Previously, the message explaining why a component
-         couldn't be moved was visable only for a few msec.
- 10/24/85 New feature added: a simple macro facitity to group a sequence
-         of commands. Similar to the keystroke facility, the 'mouse'
-         entries are stored in an internal buffer that can be replayed
-         at a different position.
- 10/29/85 Saving work with the componet/solder side flipped will no longer
-         cause the colors to be exchanged if the saved image is reloaded.
-         Also: 'wtrace' was fixed so that it no longer adds one point to
-         vectors when 2 diagonal lines meet at an right angle such that
-         there are 3 points touching each other. This caused isolated
-         select bits in the bitmap which could confuse other operations.
-         Also: menu erases a larger area so that long text items do not
-         leave some characters on the screen (cosmetic problem).
-         Also: update can now reclaim deleted table space for components
-         and types (frequent updates could run out of table space).
- 11/2/85 'vhole' in 'pwork.c' fixed so that it is no longer confused if
-         the attched functions delete the trace (such as in 'delc').
-         Previously, 'delete' (in all its incarnations) could leave parts
-         of a net unconnected and undeleted if the net used certain
-         complex via-holes.
-         Also: The re-route wire straihtening option was fixed so that it
-         can handle wires open ended wires. Previously, there was a 50%
-         chance that it could not find the path to the single end point.
- 11/6/85 Improved delete alorithm: the delete function tries now to
-         guess when the endpoints of a deleted line should stay. Previously,
-         they were allways deleted if they did not contribute to a
-         electrical connection which would shorten the remaining line
-         segment (some user didn't like that).
