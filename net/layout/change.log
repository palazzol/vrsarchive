7/4/85	Redundant extern declarations of members of <stdio.h> removed.
	Redundant "string.h" is no longer referenced. This should
	avoid warnigs on BSD 4.2 systems.
7/8/85  CRMOD added to the AED terminal line initialization. This should
	help on other systems.
7/23/85 r0 in fillet hole routine reduced to 72 (from 82) because of
	potential interaction with nearby via-holes: if the via-hole
        is positioned 6/4 uints from the component hole AND a wire
        leaves the component hole diagonally towards the unrelated
	via hole, the seperation between fillet and wire becomes
        6.5 mil (instead of 8 mil) with the old fillet size.
