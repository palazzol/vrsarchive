This is release 3  of starchart, actually  now starchart/observe, plus
supporting  programs and data  files.  Starchart produces astronomical
charts from  a variety of databases,  producing output  for,  in rough
order  of quality, PostScript,  X11, Sunview, Atari  ST, IBM  PC, X10,
tektronix, unix plot, HP laserjet, and  tty displays, on Unix, vms and
other systems.   It is straightforward   to  write drivers  for  other
output devices.   Observe is    a  multifunction program for   use  in
planning an observing session.  It calculates the positions of planets
and their  satellites,  asteroids and  comets,  calculates rising  and
setting  times, and much more.  Observe  complements the Ephem program
previously posted in comp.sources.misc.

This version of starchart is compatible with earlier versions written
by awpaeth.

Databases for starchart  were posted  to comp.sources.unix:   volume12
contains the previous version including  a version  of the yale bright
star  catalog, and volume16  contains a  version  of the  SAO catalog.
This  version supports the Hubble  Space  Telescope Guide Star Catalog
version 1.0.   A nebula database is available  and may be submitted in
the future.  Archive sites for databases are  much desired, contact me
as ccount@athena.mit.edu to arrange things.
