These are data files to accompany the starchart program.

boundaries.star		constellation boundaries
cnames.star		constellation names
con.locs		constellation locations
index.indx		sample index file for SAO data (see below)
pattern.star		constellation patterns
reg_to_indx.perl	generate index file for GSC CD rom (see below)

The  *.star files are courtesy Dave  Van't  Hof.  The con.locs file is
from Bob Tidd, modified by Dave.

You  will  also need a   bright star file,   typically  yale.star from
comp.sources.unix volume 12 (patches in volume 13),  and  optionally a
larger database, for example the converted SAO database available from
comp.sources.unix volume 16, or the GSC CD_ROM.

If you have  the GSC CD_ROM,  you should generate  an index.indx  file
(perhaps  name it    "gsc.indx"   and  alter   the starchart  Makefile
accordingly).   See  reg_to_indx.perl  for   details.  The    file  so
generated is too large to include in this distribution.

A nebula  database  file was  posted  to sci.astro  in   the past, and
another may be posted to a source group by mid-1990.

See sci.astro  or   the astronomy  mailing list  for   news of   other
databases.
