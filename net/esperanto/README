This package is an Esperanto->English translation program.  At this point
it is quite crude, but a lot faster than looking stuff up in a dictionary.
The translation is morpheme for morpheme, and it is handy to have a real
dictionary at hand to assist with some of the strange cases.

Files:
	esperanto.l	a Franz Lisp program
	esp.root	2500 of the most important roots
	esp.pref	the prefixes
	esp.suf		the suffixes
	esp.nroot	additional roots, created with the '=' command
				during (interpret)

Comments, improvements, and correspondants are desired!
