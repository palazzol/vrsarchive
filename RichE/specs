.H 1 "REQUIREMENTS"
.AL
.LI
Changes to System V/386 to allow the kernel and user processes to address
virtual addresses which map to physical addresses up to 64 megabytes.
.LI
Changes to I/O Drivers necessitated by the fact that the Multibus I address
space will still be restricted to 16 Megabytes.
.LI
Stability and functionality equivalent to the existing System V/386.
.LI
Have these changes completed and tested by April 1, 1987.
.LE
.H 1 "GOALS/NON-GOALS"
.AL
.LI
First, meet all requirements with minimal changes to existing System V/386
code.  The schedule requirement implies initial implementation will not
contain even obvious performance optimizations unless they are also the
most time efficient solutions to meet the other requirements.
.LI
The changes will be designed with support for 128 megabytes of physical
memory in mind.  The system will be tested for 128 megabyte operation
only if time and hardware permit.
.LI
Extra time (if any) will be used to implement performance enhancements.
.H 1 "COMPONENTS"
.AL
.LI
Changes to initialization so the kernel's address space can be large enough
to map physical memory.
.LI
Changes to initialization required by the relocation of data structures
moved to accommodate the physical memory map.
.LI
Changes to the 214 driver to request DMA only from addresses less than 16
megabytes.  For addresses above 16 megabytes, the driver must use a copying
scheme.  (Initial implementation will use a copying scheme for all transfers
for simplicity and reliability.  One of the first optimizations would be to
fix this).
.LI
Changes to other drivers which use memory mapped I/O or DMA.  This probably
includes the 546 and the 552 drivers.

.H 1 "RISKS"
.AL
.LI
Since the changes involve very low level subsystems of System V/386, debugging
will be difficult.
.LI
Hardware is not expected until 1 week before delivery to Rich Engineering.
Obviously, if either hardware or software require extensive debugging,
schedule will not be met.
.LE
.H 1 "ARs"
.H 2 "Bob Rossi/George Heider"
To proceed with implementation on a Beta-1 base, I will need a 7x9 386/20
with more that 4 megabytes of memory ASAP.
.H 2 "Bob Rossi/Brandy Coughlin"
I would like Brandy Coughlin to look into an alleged bug which prevents the
existing System V/386 implementation from working with more than 4 megabytes
of physical memory.  I will need a resolution for this bug by March 1, 1987.
