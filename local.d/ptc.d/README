Setting up the Pascal to C translator.

The translator is a single huge Pascal program. If you are working on a UNIX
system that has a Pascal compiler what you need to do is to unpack and
concatenate the four parts forming the translator sourcecode, "ptc.p",
unpack the "makefile", say "make ptc" and take a break.

If you are on a non-UNIX system proceed with discretion.

If compilation fails due to the program size you may consider attacking the C
version, "ptc.c", if this too is too large to compile you may as well give up.
If it fails to compile or run for other reasons you may try to contact me.

When/if the ptc program is created you may try saying "make tests", this should
not produce any output at all. If it does it means that ptc obtained from ptc.p
differed in behaviour from cptc obtained from ptc.c obtained from ptc.p. In that
case your Pascal and/or C compilers depart seriously from the ones availible to
the author, this may imply a bug in ptc.

Read the section "Tuning" in the implementation notes and do what you believe
is appropriate for your installation; recompile and install binary and man-page
as necessary.

Send vitriolic comments to /dev/null;
checks, constructive critisism and bug-reports to the address below.


Sincerely,
