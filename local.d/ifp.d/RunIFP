# Shell script for invoking IFP interpreter.

# This script is for demonstration and documentation purposes only.
# Running the script will set the appropriate environment variables
# and start up the IFP interpreter in the demonstration directory.

# All its actions should be put in the user's .login, and .cshrc files.
# The IFP interpreter must be compiled before running this script.
# See the Makefile in subdirectory "interp" for instructions on how
# to compile the interpreter.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# These two lines should go in each user's .login file and be customized
# for the user's particular IFP root directory and editor. 

	setenv IFProot $cwd/fproot
	setenv EDITOR "/usr/ucb/vi"

# This alias is for convenience.  Presumably the interpreter will normally
# reside on the user's search path.

	alias ifp $cwd/interp/ifp

# Normally the user would type in the following two lines:

	cd fproot/demo
	ifp

# The interpreter will respond with the prompt "ifp>" when ready for 
# user input.
