(*
 * Currently I/O is almost non-existent in IFP.  One way to skirt this problem
 * when you have a large amount of data to input is to define a constant 
 * function with the appropriate values.
 *
 * The function Data returns a sequence of data values.  We could, for 
 * instance, sort them by composing Data with QuickSort
 *
 * Examples:
 *      0 : Data -> <5 3 88 6 21 0 -7>
 *      0 : Data | QuickSort -> <-7 0 3 5 6 21 88>
 *)

DEF Data AS
   #<5 3 88 6 21 0 -7>;
