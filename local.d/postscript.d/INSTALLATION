Note that is necessary to run a shell with job-control (e.g. csh) on
the sun3 version when using PS, because of process-group problems with
suntools. It is also difficult to alter the window shape when PS is
doing output on suns. If the postscript/viewer pair are used, these
problems are not encountered, but it runs more slowly.

To try it out, type the following:
	$ POSTSCRIPTLIB=<where ever the postscript directory is>/postscript
	$ export POSTSCRIPTLIB
	$ PS -c 'A4 (demos/wow) lib run'
	$ 

The "showpage" operator expects a carriage return before it erases the
page and allows output to continue (or in this case for PS to
terminate).  More generally, use:

	$ PS -c A4 [ files .... ]
	$ 

The A4 command is shorthand for a framedevice command (see the
postscript reference manual) to create an A4 sized window. It is
supposed to be actual size, except on suns, where the screen is not big
enough (!)

It also works on the perq, but much more slowly.

If PostScript is not to be fully installed, the environment variable
POSTSCRIPTLIB may be set to the pathname of /usr/lib/postscript.
Alternatively, config.c has a variable called default_library[], which
may be changed to point somewhere else.
