This is a virtually complete implementation of PostScript.  Just type
make and it should produce a version for suns.  Since the only complete
driver is for suns and since some driver writing will be necessary on
any other machine, I have not packaged everything up in an idiot-proof
box.  I am not aware of any Gotchas in building this source.  The X
driver used to work on X10 - It will need work for X11.  The pixrect
driver is very new, and should be regarded as didactic, as it scribbles
straight onto the display.  Persuading suntools to look after the bits
would have taken too long.

Writing your own driver involves merely hacking pixrect.c until it will
drive your display.  There are only 11 routines to write, and they're
all quite short.

Have fun!
