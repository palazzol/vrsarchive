.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pass.chk
[

.SH DESCRIPTION
By default
.I pass.chk
only checks for accounts with passwords the same
as the login name. The following options add more extensive checking. (The
tradeoff is cpu time -- with all options enabled it can run into the 100's
of MINUTES.) Any argument that does not begin with a "-" is assumed to be
a file name. (A single '-' means stdin.) If no file name is given, /etc/passwd
is used.
