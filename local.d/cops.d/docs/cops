.I cops
uses three internal variables that may be changed to determine where
who gets any reports generated, if it is to mailed or saved to a file.
The variable $SECURE_USERS is used to determine who gets mailed any
results.  $SECURE is the directory that
.I cops
is in.  And finally, if the variable $MAIL is set to be NO, then
.I cops
will save the report in a file called
.I report.$$
, where $$ is the process id number of cops (this will change
everytime), otherwise,
.I cops
will mail the report to the whomever is listed in $SECURE_USERS.
