This archive contains the IBM-PC specific source code for XLISP
version 2.1.  In order to recompile XLISP, you'll also need the
generic code archive.  These files were designed to be used with
Turbo C v2.0 and will probably need to be changed to use any other
compiler.  Before attempting to recompile any of the modules, make
sure that the symbol _TURBOC_ is defined at the top of 'xlisp.h'
where the machine type is specified (right under the copyright
notice).
