.TH READ20 1 RAND
.SH NAME
read20 \- read a tape produced by the TOPS20 Dumper Program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B read20
\%[\-f tapefile] \%[\-t] \%[-n number] \fIstring\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Read20
reads tapes produced by the TOPS20 backup and archival program
\fIDumper20\fR, producing directory listings and
optionally extracting files.

If no \fIstring\fR is specified, just a directory of the tape
is produced.  Otherwise, every file that contains \fIstring\fR
in its filename
will be extracted to the current working directory.
The UNIX filenames of extracted files are generated from the
filename on the tape by stripping off the device name, directory
names and the version number.

It should be noticed that \fIstring\fR is
.B not
a generalized
pattern, just a string that is matched against all the characters
in the filenames.  Special characters (such as '\<' and '\>') must
be quoted to get past the shell.

The directory listing prints out for every file
.IP
the size in pages of the file (on the twenty)
.br
the number of bytes in the file
.br
the \fIbytesize\fR (or number of bits per byte) of the file
.br
the time and date the file was last modified
.br
the full pathname of the file.

.LP
This program currently only extracts text files.  It decides
whether or not a file is text by examining the
\fIbytesize\fR of the file.  If it has 7-bit bytes, it is assumed to
be a text file.  If it is anything else, it is assumed to be
a binary file and requests to extract it are ignored.

Occasionally, text files have a \fIbytesize\fR 36 instead of the proper
\fIbytesize\fR 7.
The \-t flag forces these files to be considered as
text files and extracted (but only if their names contain the \fIstring\fR).

Alternate tape devices may be specified with the \-f flag.

Occasionally, the first 14 characters of extracted files can be
the same.  If this is the case, use the \-n flag.  This will cause
the Unix filenames to be numeric (starting with the number following
the -n).  The mapping between the number Unix filenames and the
original Tops-20 names is appended to the file "Logfile".

.SH DEFAULTS
/dev/rmt0 is the default tapefile.

.SH BUGS
The
.I string
must be upper case to match the filename on the tape.

There is no option yet for discarding the carriage-return
from the newline sequence.  This can be done with most
editors or with the command
.IP
tr \-d '\\015' < file > newfile
.LP

TOPS20 allows longer filenames than the current version of UNIX.
Very long filenames are truncated as they are extracted, which
opens up the possibility of multiple tape files being
written to the same UNIX file.  There is currently no checking
done to prevent this.

Files which span tape boundaries are handled poorly.  To extract
such a file, extract each piece and then combine the files under
UNIX.

Files which have been
.I archived
can show up in directory listings with a
.I bytesize
of zero.

When extracting files, you still get a full directory listing;
this has led some folks to believe they were extracting the
entire tape.
