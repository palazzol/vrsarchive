Tue Oct 23 1984 - wnl (1.4)
	Finally fixed the hash table bug that caused processes owned by
	root to sometimes appear with either no name or a different name
	that had UID 0 (such as "operator").  Removed all the ifdef DEBUG
	blocks to make top ready for distribution to the real world.

Sun Apr  8 1984 - wnl (still 1.3)
	Made some slight changes to the display format.  It now looks more
	aesthetically pleasing.  Added some preprocessor constants so that
	the two defaults (number of processes and seconds of delay) easier
	to change.

Thu Apr  5 1984 - wnl (1.3)
	Changed the order in which things are done at initialization time.
	This way, if an error occurs before starting the main loop, curses
	will never get started.  Also changed other error handlers so that
	endwin() is called before any flavor of exit.  Specifying a number
	of processes that is more than the screen can handle is no longer
	fatal.  It displays a warning message and pretends the user
	specified the maximum for the screen.  Finally cured all the TSTP
	blues (well, almost all).  I removed my TSTP handler and convinced
	the system to always use the one that curses sets up.  Turns out
	that "sleep" was stepping all over it during a pause.  So, I don't
	use sleep anymore.  The only problem that remains with it now is
	redrawing the old display before updating it after a pause.

Tue Apr  3 1984 - wnl (from 1.0 to 1.2)
	I changed the format of the TIME column from just "seconds" to
	"minutes:seconds".  I also made pausing work correctly.  Screen
	redraws with an up to date display.  For compatability with 4.2, I
	changed the name of the "zero" function to "bzero".  The makefile
	has been altered to handle versions for 4.1 and 4.2, and README
	has been updated to reflect these recent changes.
