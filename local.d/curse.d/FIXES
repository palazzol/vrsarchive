 
 DESCRIPTION:
                'curse' doesn't use the current size of the window
 when the -ll option cannot find a 'quick to last line' entry in the
 termcap.

 REPEAT-BY:     
                If you have a terminal which is NOT 24 lines tall and
 whose termcap entry doesn't contain the 'll' option, run:

 curse -ll

 You'll end up some weird place (column 0, line 23).

 FIX-BY:
                Use LINES and COLS, as defined by 'curses', in order
 to figure out your screen's size.  This allows for two easy options
 to get the numbers of lines and columns of your terminal, say in 
 shell variables:  

 lines=`curse -li`
 or
 set lines=`curse -li`

 diff.{c,1}  are ed(1) scripts for curse.c and curse.1 respectively.
 The two new options are -li and -co.
