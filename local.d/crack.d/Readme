This is a general purpose utility to check for frequently used passwords.  The
database of possible passwords is represented as a list of quoted strings in
the file "crack.h".  The source for most of this was the netnews map, which
provides a list of netnews sites.  I took this list, added some local site
names, user's first names, and the odd word or two to make the current list.
If you keep it to one password per line you can do things like sort, grep,
etc. on it.

The file crack.c is the source code for the password scan.  Note that there
are two special cases: the user's login name and the name of the password
file (system name if /etc/passwd is being scanned) are always tried.  This
is to check for the all too common practices of setting the login name as
a user password, or setting the machine name as an administrative password.

The output should be self explanatory.  The input is a file, either /etc/passwd
by default, or a file which should be named after the system from which it
came.
