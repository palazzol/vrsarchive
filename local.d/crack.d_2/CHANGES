Changes file:-

-> Crack 2.7

* Not documented as were expected to be internal only.  Ha bloody ha.

-> Late July 1991

* Posted Crack v2.7 to the net and was immediately swamped with email

* Arranged archiving @ wuarchive.wustl.edu - ~/packages

-> 31 July 1991 v3.1

* First release of Crack 3.1.

* Decided to post future releases with fcrypt() installed.

* Put another 100eps on xform() by using direct addressing of Sn[]
  arrays in the main loop of xform()

* Oddly enough, using a direct addressing trick instead of (*dp STEP)
  slows things down on the 5000/200 - I'll leave it as it was.

-> 1 Aug 1991 v3.1b

* Modified Scripts/joinfiles to filter out locked/null account passwords
  - This fixes a load imbalance on Crack -network.  O/P > crack.inital.

* Removed CRACK_USERNAME as a option - make it mandatory, it's silly to
  bother turning it off.  Ditto CRACK_USERNAME2

* Modified method of argument parsing in Crack script for more
  flexibility

* Added a few extra comments to Crack

* Changed Scripts/crack.mf for clarity

* Crack-pwc now uses linked lists for dictionary handling - dicts can be
  read in until you run out of memory and it crashes.  Fun, eh ?

* Since linked list handling uses pushdown lists, I reversed order of
  sort in Scripts/makedicts to counteract dictionary reversal - passwords
  are more common towards the start of the alphabet.  Lazy or what ?

* Removed CRACK_WARN/CRACK_NULLED as options as these jobs are done by
  Scripts/joinfiles now.  Code left in crack-pwc though, just in case.

* Crack-pwc now creates the output file, not Crack

* Crack-pwc now does checkpointing.  Will need to write recover code
  soon.

* Renamed output files to "out.*" instead of "crack.*" - also uses the
  same PID

* Crack-pwc now uses getopt()

* Put -V (verbose) option in : defining CRACK_VERBOSE is still necessary
  to be able to use this option, however.  It generated a 1Mb file in 90
  seconds though, so I'm gonna keep it switched off, personally.

* Changed CRACK_NICE to -Nnumber option

* Changed crack-pwc so that input is from stdin _or_ "-Ifilename"

-> August 2 1991 v3.1b

* Paranoia is cracking me up.  in "Crack" when I invoke "-network" with
  the crack-pwc >& /dev/null < /dev/null - nothing happens.  Well, rather
  nothing happened.  Until I tried it again this morning.  Now it works.
  Hmmmmmmm.

* Checkpointing recover code in now spattered all over crack-pwc.c

* The whole idea is that you invoke Crack EXACTLY as before, with the
  attition of the "-Rpoint.filename.pid" switch.

* If it's not a network Crack, the job will restart where it left off.

* If it IS a network Crack, the whole "rsh" schmeer will take place
  again, but "crack-pwc" will be left running ONLY on the machine named in
  the pointfile.  If you need to run it on a different host, change the
  name of the host in the pointfile. This could cause problems tho.

* Fixed Scripts/Crack.network to parse arguments and allow network.conf
  to contain per-hostname Crack arguments.

* Fixed Scripts/RCrack to support the above

* Started reworking README in ms macros

-> August 5 1991 v3.1b

* Totally rewritten README

* Doublechecked fcrypt() still works on Sun 4/330 - works fine.

* Tidied fcrypt() configuration symbols into conf.h and reworked some
  comments in conf.h for readability

-> 7/8 Aug 1991 v3.1b

* *!*!*!*!*!* LOWERCASED ALL OPTION SWITCHES

* Added new -R as distinct from -r in that it recovers with a username
  check.

* Introduced Sources/crack-port.c with a version of gethostname() which
  uses uname() on SysV like systems.  Use CRACK_UNAME switch in
  Sources/conf.h to enable this.

* Edited Scripts/RCrack to put 'rsh' into a variable name for easier
  access to SysV or SCO ppl who want to change it to 'rcmd'.

* Fixed up the README a bit more

* Redid CRACK_PW_TRUNCATE to be more clever, as CRACK_PW_VERIFY

-> 9 Aug 1991 v3.1c

* Removed library type stuff from Sources/Makefile - Chris Lewis pointed
  out problems this would generate with portability.

* Batching alternative version of Crack script written in 'sh'

* Crack.sh finished and documented (slightly)

* Fixed remaining bug left from lowercasing switches...  next time I'll
  be quicker to check my getopt() string

* Did a better MANIFEST file

* Found a bug in Scripts/crack.mf - there was no target for $(DICTSRC) -
  fixed.  This showed up when 'makekit' dropped the bad_pws.dat file

-> 12 Aug 1991 v3.2a

* Putting a simplified numerics pass into the preprocessor to create an
  additional dictionary.

* Got a mail message from a guy telling me that I should sort&uniq my
  dictionaries - evidently he hasn't been reading the shellscripts, just
  the code.  Ah well.

* Revamped docs for things I'd missed

* Made o/p of pwc in Crack a variable - that way I can select it at the
  top of the file

* Fixed a bug in GetPoint - didnt always return NULL when it should

* Found a pointing bug in Pass2 - if data HAD changed, program could
  have walked off the end of the linked list.

* Emptied network.conf for distribution

* Bought the new 'Jam' CD compilation

* Attempted to wrap progs up for testing.

-> Aug 19th 1991 v3.2a

* Got back from Cropredy with a list of things to do.

* Created new way of putting dicts into crack - just drop them into
  DictSrc and the program should take care of the rest of it.  Saves
  editing files and with dictionaries.tar.Z now available, it will save
  a lot of bother for people - they just have to drop them into the
  directory.  Updated docs accordingly.

* Created APPENDIX file for people who query my methods and sanity.

* added personalisation to conf.h for my purposes only.  Also, according
  to one guy, his system barfed the comments in conf.h because they
  started on the same line as a #undef.

* Crack-pp now ignores dictionary lines beginning with '#' - this allows
  the Klein dictionaries to be dropped straight into the DictSrc
  directory.

* Crack-pwc now tries a username+reversed username permutation that
  someone suggested, I've forgotten who and it's buried in 3Mb of email.

* Redid the manifest (again) .

* Modified CRACK_TRAILING to do a leading-digits pass.

* Crack-pwc.c now skips empty dictionaries.

* I found that in using wildcards in Scripts/crack.mf, I created a
  problem.  The DICTSRC target contined a member DictSrc/* which was
  always out of date, because it was never made when I called 'make
  dictstamp' - Make looks for something literally called 'DictSrc/*' and
  not the individual files.  Hopefully, removing the (blank) dependency
  for $(DICTSRC) will fix this.  Subtle and annoying.

-> Aug 20th 1991 v3.2a

* Tagged a few extra comments onto APPENDIX

-> Aug 21st 1991 v3.2a

* Cleaned up a bit of the README files. Ready for release.

* Last minute check - found that using 'gcc' as opposed to 'cc' made
  fcrypt() slow and incompatible with the standard crypt() - this is not
  nice.

-> Aug 22nd 1991 v3.2a

* First bug reports coming back.  AIX doesnt like fcrypt(), possibly due
  to putting numbers > 255 in a u_char in fcrypt() - fixed this.

-> Aug 23rd 1991 v3.2a

* Second major bug report in "plaster" - should not assume '.' is in the
  path, is a security hole.  Fixed.

* Apparently fixing the >8bit bytes does not help fcrypt() on AIX - it
  still fails.  Bother.

-> Aug 27 1991 v3.2b

* Put newlines in AWK script embedded in Scripts/RCrack - apparently
  some awks need linebreaks

* Pointfile now contains a datestamp obtained from ctime() - saves on
  headaches.

* crack-fcrypt.c: removed use of R[] block by finding the ONE place it
  was referenced and replacing it with a modified reference to L[].
  This means that the new L[] is the old R[] + L[].  There are no more
  contiguity problems, so 'gcc' now works, but it is slower than the
  output of 'cc' on my DECStation.  Caveat Emptor.

* Crack rewritten in 'sh'

* Scripts rewired for greater flexibility

-> 28 Aug 1991 v3.3a

* Fixed bug in init() stuff - a tmpE array was declared with size [32]
  and not [48] - this was causing problems on a Sun 3, causing coredumps.

* Clarified Endianitis in conf.h - definitely traced to fcrypt problems
  on RS/6000 and HP's.

* Added Chris Stassens (?) improvements to the load balancing algorithm
  in Crack.network

* Wired -N switch into crack-pwc to prevent Crack.network working unless
  CRACK_NETWORK defined.

-> 29 Aug 1991 v3.3a

* Fixed up a few filenames which > 14 chars long.  Probably missed a
  few.  Hohum.

* Added env variable CRACK_OUT to Crack, as a directory to put output files.

* Spent rest of day playing with Oraperl.

-> 29 Aug 1991 v3.3a

* Fixed up crack-pp dictionary preprocessor to be more flexible about
  when it generates plurals...  I originally restricted it to lowercase
  words in order to keep it under control, but it has proved so horribly
  successful that it needs extending.

* Put "umask 077 in Crack"

* Touched up README.FIRST in anticipation of the next release.

* Touched up README.

-> 3rd Sep 1991 v3.3a

* crack-pwc now unlinks "die" and "point" files on exit

* Scripts/do_join now traps passwords with '*' '!' and SPCs anywhere
  in the string, and logs them to file.

* Found some people are posting patches to comp.sources.bugs without
  telling me all about it.  Most annoying, but at least it means that
  the fixes are going out.  Hohum.  I suppose you must get used to it if
  you go round casting your pearls before swine...  8-)

-> 4th Sep 1991 v3.3a

* Crack now can run in foreground mode (-f option) :- useful for
  invocation from other programs.  Unlike the patches which other ppl
  supply to do this job, Crack 3.3 actually does a bit of sanity
  checking of arguments (eg: no foreground mode for Crack -network),
  and it warns of the importance of the out.init.$$ file.

* Crack-pp now does somewhat better pluralisation.  If any linguists
  dare tell me about the weak points and exceptions, they can go stuff
  themselves.  8-)

* Crack.network now distributes load on basis of salted lines -
  splitting salts evenly over the network.  This satisfies some pedants,
  and to be honest, even I was quite surprised at the way that the load
  rebalances.

* Changes name of point.<host>.<pid> to pnt.<host>.<pid>

* Put feedback code into crack-pwc

* Created simple feedback script in Scripts directory.

-> 4th Sep 1991 v3.3a

* Tidied up feedback code in crack-pwc.c

* Put all runtime diagnostic files into directory 'Runtime'

* Got rid of the MCB pass - it never showed anything up anyway.  No
  doubt someone will attack me for this though...

* Inserted feedback-filter code into Crack

* Had lunch in the arts centre with my sister.

* After a few hours fighting with fcrypt(), basically inlining the whole
  of toBA64(), I measure fcrypt() as 15 times faster than standard.
  Found a compiler weirdness too - read the bottom of the XForm()
  function in crack-fcrypt.c

-> 5th Sep 1991 v3.3a

* Fixed a bug in crack-lib.c - Initcap wasn't working properly

* Fixed up feedback mode to lookup guessable and non-guessable
  passwords, and wired code into do_join instead of independent utility.

* NEW FORMAT NETWORK.CONF - allows specification of different usernames
  for 'rsh', and ability to specify a copy of Crack OTHER than that you
  are using.

* Created a slightly duboius Scripts/shadmrg script, to merge
  /etc/shadow on Sys V systems

* Fixed CRACK_GECOS so that it took in info AFTER a ','

-> 9th Sep 1991 v3.3a

* reinstated MCB pass as reverse forced capitalised

-> 11th Sep 1991

* Installed serries of patches back from bct@hull.cs, lots of minor
  for protability probs and a new feature - smart rsh-ing.

-> 13th Sep 1991

* Okay, I won't go into detail because its horribly complex, but at
  least simpler that Brian's solution (grin)...  Crack can do remote
  processing on machines without NFS by invoking them with the '-f'
  option (specified in network.conf) and backgrounding the rsh on the
  server, rather than letting it exit.  Functionally identical but a bit
  neater.

* Trivial bugfix - crack-pp no longer exits when it finds it cannot read
  a source dictionary.  It just warns about it.

-> Wed 18th Sep 1991

* Got Gilly to proofread the README file...  tidied it up quite a bit.

* Got some more back off BCT about the state of Crack 3.3c.  There was a
  fencing error in saltcount and it RCrack needed a sanity check
  installing to prevent it from rshing to another machine with no data
  to crack.  Have installed similar trap in Crack.network.  Removed
  reference to /dev/tty in RCrack's big awk script.

* Found bugs in the pluralisation algorithms, mostly to do with over
  zealout fprintfs.  Reimplemented more elegantly.

-> 19th Sep 1991

* Added/documented guess2fbk script

-> 20th Sep 1991

* Packaged v3.3 up ready to go.

* Had a great idea.

* Started work on v4.0.
