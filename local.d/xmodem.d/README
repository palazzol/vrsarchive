The two compiled programs, xmodrec and xmodtran, will be moved to the
/usr/local directory.  If this is not where you want them, change the
Makefile DIR variable to what you want for your system.

The programs are being used on a VAX 750 with BSD 4.2.  They are used
to transfer data between IBM PCs and the VAX.
