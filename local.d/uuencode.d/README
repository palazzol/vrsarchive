That's because they are the same program.  Four people have worked on those
programs...  Mark, Alan, Fred and Bryce. (see the source for full names
and net addresses).  I'm Bryce, the latest.

Both versions produce identical encodings.  The comp.sources.misc version
has a new uudecode that handles BITNET.  This is the only difference.

These uu*codes where designed to be totally forward *and* backward compatible.
The decode can use old encoded files, and the encode will produce files that
an old decode can deal with.  Works real slick.

The new features are; checksums on each line, and a file size check
(in case an entire line got deleted, or you run AmigaDOS which cares
how large a file is).  Old uudecodes could have an error or three...
but you may never find out (until too late).

The version posted to comp.sys.amiga is old.  j.cc.purdue was down the
same day I sent the new version and Craig decided to post the old one.
(Murphy and his laws!!)
(It has been about two months since I sent the old one to him... he had
another "better" uu*code from the ST group that turned out to be vapor;
full of bugs, sloppy code and hard to convert back to an Amiga/UNIX
style interface. It also did not do checksums or filesize.)

BITNET has an incorrect ASCII<->EBCDIC table!!  I finally talked to
such a site, thus the upgrade.

The theory is that the table will get mangled the exact same way the file
was mangled.  It knows that the table *should* have, can compare with the
file, and can fix it up.  Only works on files encoded by it.

This is not in my uuencode/uudecode.  I do not plan to add it.  I do,
however, have code in my uudecode that checks for mangled files.  It can
even decode a damaged *old* file.
Common damage is spaces get changed to tabs, spaces get truncated at the
end of a line, BITNET hosts mangle the ASCII, etc.  The first is solved
by encoding space as "`", the rest are checks in the decode and thus
apply to any file, new or old.

The uudecode will report "Checksum error" to stderr only if the file was
encode with checksums.  It will report "file size mismatch" only if the
file has a file size encoded in it.  The space truncate and ASCII checks
are always active.  100% forward and back compatible.

My contributions to the code are free for all to use... use 'em, abuse 'em,
even put them on the BSD 4.4 tapes.  I'd like that, since I would then
have the security of receiving checksumed files, instead of just sending
them out!!!
