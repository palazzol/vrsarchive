#	Add capitalization information to an ispell dictionary
#
#	Usage:
#
#	fixdict dict-file
#
#	Requires availability of UNIX spell.  The new dictionary is
#	rewritten in place.  A list of words that couldn't be
#	resolved (because spell doesn't know them) is written to
#	standard output.  This list appears in lowercase in the
#	dictionary, and if there are any errors the must be edited
#	by hand.
#
#	The final dictionary appears in expanded form and must be
#	passed through munchlist to regenerate suffixes.
