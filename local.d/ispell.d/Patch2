This is Patch Number 2 to the beta posting of ispell.  Ispell is an
interactive spell-checking program that is faster, more friendly, and
more flexible than standard UNIX spell.  The beta posting itself and
patch 1 are available from the comp.sources.misc archives.

This patch only addresses serious bugs.  Minor fixes and improvements
will be held over until the next release.

Bugs fixed in this patch:

    (1)	Ispell accepted "conveies" as a spelling of "conveys", contrary
	to the documentation in ispell.4.
    (2) If ispell was run from emacs, or with multiple files, and
	words were added to the dictionary, the personal dictionary
	was clobbered.  (Michael Wester, Doug Lind)

To install this patch:

    From rn, type "|patch -d dir", where dir is the directory where you
    have ispell installed.  From other newsreaders, save the article, then
    type "patch -d dir <savefile" where savefile is the name of the file
    you just created.
