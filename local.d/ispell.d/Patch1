This is Patch Number 1 to the beta posting of ispell.  Ispell is an
interactive spell-checking program that is faster, more friendly, and
more flexible than standard UNIX spell.  The beta posting itself is
available from the comp.sources.misc archives.

Well, once again it's proven that one shouldn't put a posting together
hastily in the middle of the night.  I am rather embarrassed at the
number and nature of the bugs in my ispell beta posting, but I guess
that's water under the bridge at this point.

The patch below renames "fixdict.sh" to "fixdict.X" (by dint of recreating
it);  you may want to remove "fixdict.sh" (make clean does this).

Bugs fixed in this patch:

    (1) If CAPITALIZE mode is selected, the wrongletter() routine may fail to
	properly generate all possibilities.
    (2) There were several syntax errors in xgets.c if MAXINCLUDEFILES was
	nonzero;  also the #if test was backwards (Johan Widen).
    (3) Several Makefile problems:  CC was not defined as "cc", fixdict.sh
	did not respect the definition of LIBDIR;  icombine (and now fixdict)
	was missing from make clean;  and make install referred to
	expand[12].sed rather than isexp[1-4].sed.  (David Neves, Gary
	Johnson, Don Kark)
    (4) In term.c, the variables oldtt{in,ou,tstp} are undefined on BSD
	systems.  (Joel Shprentz, Don Kark)
    (5) If CAPITALIZE was undefined, the routine toutent() still referred
	to the capitalization-control fields in the dictionary structure.
	(Gary Johnson)  In fact, the code with CAPITALIZE undefined had
	not been recently tested and was full of problems.  These have
	been corrected and ispell has been tested in this mode, though not
	extensively.
    (6) In TeX mode, some misspelled words could be missed because a left
	brace was not seen as a delimiter.  Also, there were still a couple
	of nroff hangovers in TeX mode.  (Don Kark).
    (7) Buildhash.c wouldn't compile without CAPITALIZE.

To install this patch:

    From rn, type "|patch -d dir", where dir is the directory where you
    have ispell installed.  From other newsreaders, save the article, then
    type "patch -d dir <savefile" where savefile is the name of the file
    you just created.
