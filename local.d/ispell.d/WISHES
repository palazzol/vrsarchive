Things remaining to be done to ispell:

	- The single biggest remaining deficiency (in my opinion) is the
	  extensive misuse of 'strlen'.  Strlen is often called repeatedly
	  on the same string within a few lines of code.  Worse, many
	  routines accept a "length" parameter (which is usually passed
	  by running 'strlen' within the arglist) but ignore it and
	  actually require the string to be null-terminated.  Somebody
	  should do a systematic edit and clean this up.  I wouldn't
	  be surprised to learn that ispell spends 50% of its time in
	  strlen.
	- The "munchlist" script can actually increase the size of a
	  dictionary.  For example, munching dict.191 (after my bugfixes
	  to it) reduced the number of words by about 40, but increased
	  the number of characters by a small percentage.  This is
	  because munchlist doesn't recognize duplicate suffixes that
	  generate the same result, except for the three special
	  "s-ending" suffixes J, Z, and X.  For example, right now
	  munchlist will make BATHER by adding the R suffix to both
	  BATH and BATHE.  It would be nice if munchlist could recognize
	  the redundancy and reduce its output so that each word was made
	  in only one way.
