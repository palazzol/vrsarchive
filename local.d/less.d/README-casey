I've made four changes to less:

1.	You can now install the pager_patch program to let you use less as
	your default pager even if the programs you're using don't pay
	attention to the PAGER environment variable.

2.	It's now allowable to invoke less with "-[z]N" to specify the window
	scroll size ala more (note that the "z" may be omitted) - this
	was done for compatibility with more(1) as some programs (ex: msgs)
	called the pager with a window size specification.

3.	Less will now detect "boldfacing sequences" and use the /etc/termcap
	capability "md" and "me" to boldface the corresponding text.
	Boldface sequences are sequences of a character overstruck with
	backspaces (ex: a^Hab^Hb ...).  Any number of overstrikes are ok.
	For those whose nroff doesn't generate these sequences for [default]
	boldfacing, look at the file n10-diff for the necessary changes to
	nroff [n10.c].

4.	The manual page has been reformatted to have more boldface sequences
	(some may find my avoidance of ".B", ".I", etc. to be annoying, but
	what the hey, I'll let Mark Nudelman (less's original author) have
	the final decision).  I haven't reorganized the command and switch
	descriptions to be in alphabetic order ...  Still not sure whether
	that should be done ...
