 This is a public domain version of the command "strings" available
in the Berkeley distributions. It is slightly more intellgent than
the aforementioned version. It was written for a friend on a Plexus
P-40 running V7. It works on his machine, but how well does Plexus
conform to V7? I dunno, that is the only example I have. In the 4.2 man
page it says that strings reports addresses in octal. The standard command
does not, so this version does not either. Simple change if you want it to
though...
