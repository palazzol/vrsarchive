The documentation is provided in three files:

emacs-doc.tex    ;Main LaTeX file that includes part1.tex and part2.tex
    part1.tex    ;first half of documentation
    part2.tex    ;second half of documentation
emacs-doc.toc    ;Table of Contents generated on a previous run of LaTeX
emacs-index.tex  ;Index entries, modified from emacs-doc.idx

The files emacs-doc.tex, part1.tex and part2.tex contain everything
needed to generate the manual for microemacs 3.8i.  The files
emacs-doc.toc and emacs-index.tex are included so that emacs-doc.dvi
can be created in one pass.

sh> latex emacs-doc

There are a couple of LaTeX warnings about underfull boxes, but they
don't make too much of a difference so I left them.

If you want to change the document so that pagebreaks will change
you will need to recreate the emacs-doc.toc and emacs-index.tex files.
The emacs-doc.toc file is created by LaTeX.  The emacs-index.tex file
is a sorted and slightly modified version of emacs-doc.idx (which is 
also created by LaTeX).
