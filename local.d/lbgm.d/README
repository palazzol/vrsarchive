    This directory contains a source-archiving system called "lbgm" (Little
Bird Gave Me).  Responsible parties are:

    lbgm		Alan S. Watt
    lbgmX		Jim Ziobro
    X			   "
    zap.so		   "
    csh protection	Larry Wall

I have cleaned it up a bit to be more flexible and robust, and added an
installation script.

To install:

    Run this shar archive to extract the programs.
    If your system doesn't take #! syntax, edit the scripts to force /bin/sh
    Define LBGMDIR and LBGMRM (see below) in your environment, or edit lbgmX
      to define them the way you want them.
    Run the install script.

LBGMDIR should be the directory you save sources in:  default is /usr/lbgm if
nothing else is specified.  LBGMRM is the program to remove unwanted sources;
define this to X (or a similar script/program) if you have delayed-deletion
facilities.  It defaults to "/bin/rm -f" if unspecified.

That's all.  You should not have to edit anything else, no matter what your
system is or where you keep news.  News will be saved in the directory
you specify, and cataloged (by the Usenet header) in 'save.log'.

If garbage shows up on net.sources, simply type "s | zap.so" from readnews or
rn.  When you exit, run $HOME/tozap to actually delete the articles (this
takes a while).  Don't forget to remove tozap when you are done.

Alan Watt's comments [edited to change the script name to lbgm]:

I don't have space to save all news forever, but I decided some time
ago that net.sources was worth keeping around, hence "lbgm".
Usage is from you news "sys" file:

	SOURCES:net.sources:B:/usr/lib/news/lbgm [ srcdir ]

where <srcdir> is where you want the stuff to go.  In there will
appear the file "save.log", which contains the news header of
every news article saved, and files of the form:

	${month}_${day}.${unique}

(as in "Apr_8.4552"), each file containing an article.  The log
file will point to the saved article.  There is a lockout against
concurrent runnings of lbgm.

You have to periodically go in by hand and delete obvious junk
(discussions and requests for stuff), and also to weed out which
version you want to keep if something is posted several times.
I have everything posted on net.sources since August 15th of last
year.

Jim Ziobro's comments:

	For those who keep archives of stuff from net.sources using an
Alan Watt lbgm (little bird gave me) style archive then you might
want a convenient way to delete the junk that may get saved there.

	I have written some small scripts which make that job easier.
When you come across junk simply pipe the offending article into
zap.so and it creates a script which will remove the article from
your lbgm archive.  After your finished reading news just invoke tozap
which was created by zap.so.

	I have include Alan Watt's original article.  As always please
keep me informed of enhancements or bugs.
