This directory contains a diff for a modified version of the lex driver
(ncform). It is not absolutely necessary to cake: the only difference
is in error detection. If you cannot or do not want to install this diff
to ncform, (e.g. cause you have an unsymphatetic root or you are worried
about AT&T's copyright on the original ncform, of which this one is a
small modification), you should keep the calls to and the definition of
check_actlen in cake_s.l; otherwise you should comment them out.

Catching lex buffer overflows is important. Some cake actions, like
make actions, are very long, but this may not be apparent, as this
length would almost certainly result from macro expansion (a link
command for a large system can easily reach hundreds of bytes).
An overflow like this, if it occurs, leads to core dump, and the bug
can be VERY HARD to track down. I know, I spent a week on it once.
