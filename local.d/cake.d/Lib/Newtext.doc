Documentation for the cakefile Newtext.

This file explains what you can do with Newtext; the macros used by
Newtext are described in Newtext.defs.

Newtext assumes that your document is in a file with a .orig or .frame
suffix; if the suffix is .frame it assumes that it is a skeleton
with .so statements including the "meat" of the document. In either case
the file should have a line containing the word NEED followed by a list
of program names from the set lbl, bib, listrefs, pic, tbl and eqn.
This line may be a ditroff comment (a line beginning with .\")
and should preferably occur near the beginning of the file.

The targets available through Newtext are:

%.laser:	Ditroff output, after putting %.orig through the listed
		preprocessors. (The names of the preprocessor commands
		and their options may be altered (see Newtext.defs).)

%.refs:		The list of bib references in the document.
%.srefs:	%.refs sorted without duplicates.
%.cit:		%.srefs looked up in a source bibliography.
		This is useful for making a local copy of the
		necessary references, allowing faster retrieval.
%.chnr:		The output of checknr.
%.cheq:		The output of checkeq.
%.ol:		Outline for -me documents.
%.fix:		A pseudo-target to invoke fix, an ispell-type spelling
		corrector.
%.ispell:	A pseudo-target to invoke ispell.
%.spell:	A list of misspelled words in the document.
%.dict:		Questionable phrases used in the document.
%.style:	Readability indexes for the document.
%.astyle:	Readability indexes for every sentence in the document.
%.exp:		Expletives in the document (as defined by style(1)).
%.mod:		Moderately hard-to-read sentences in the document.
%.hard:		Hard-to-read sentences in the document.
%.long:		Long sentences in the document.
%.pass:		Sentences containing passives.

%.all:		Run the most useful document analysis programs:
		%.spell, %.style, %.exp, %.mod, %.long, %.pass, %.dict
		and %.chnr.

%.count:
%.ocount:	The number of words in a document, measured in two ways.
		%.count counts equations, references, programs etc
		as one word; %.ocount counts them as they appear.

%.clean:	Remove the files generated from %.orig.
%.vclean:	Remove the files generated from %.frame.

clean:		Run %.clean for all %.orig.
vclean:		Run %.vclean for all %.frame.
