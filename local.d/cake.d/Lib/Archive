$	Cakefile to handle archives.

$	Define ARCH to be the name of the archive you want files
$	to be automatically extracted from. The first rule performs
$	this extraction; the second updates the archive.

#ifndef	ARCH
		it's no use trying to use Archive without defining ARCH
#endif

%1:		ARCH		if {{ar t ARCH | grep \\\^%1\\\$}}
		ar x ARCH %1

ARCH.up&:	[[ar t ARCH]]
		ar ru ARCH [[ar t ARCH]]
