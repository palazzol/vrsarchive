This directory contains some "standard" cakefiles.

Each cakefile has its own documentation, except Newtext, for which the
documentation is in Newtext.defs and Newtext.doc. Many cakefiles need
the programs and shell- and awk-scripts distributed with cake.

It contains cakefiles for C programs, yacc and lex either separately
(the files Yacc, Lex) or together (Grammar), and for NU-Prolog programs.
These can be used together with the cakefiles Main or System, which
look after linking, checking, printing etc, for directories with one
and many executables respectively.

The cakefile Newtext is a fairly general-purpose text-processing system
for ditroff. You should go through this file and modify any default
values which are not appropriate for your site; the names of the
printers in particular are site-dependent.

The cakefile Text is an older version of Newtext; you should probably
throw it away and rename Newtext to Text. The cakefiles Zs_* are
site-dependent definitions for Text and Newtext. You may want to
look at them, and perhaps modify them, but it is unlikely that they
will be very useful as they are.

The Vlsi cakefile (for the UNSW VLSI system) does the job of the
UNSW "bake" program.

This directory also contains cakefiles for RCS, SCCS and "ar",
as well as for my (zs's) microassembler; if you want a copy of uas,
just ask.
