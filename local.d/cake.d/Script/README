This directory contains those commands used by the "standard" cakefiles
which are implemented by scripts.

The commands reporting on cake stats (cs and ccs) have embedded in them
the name of the cake stats file; if you change the macro STATS_FILE
in ../conf.h, you should change these also (unless you turn off stats
altogether, of course). Apart from this, "fix" is the only program
that will require adjustments, at least on Berkeley systems.

However, on systems without #!, you will need to do some work
to replace #! /bin/sh lines with : lines and convert /bin/awk
interpreted scripts into Bourne shell scripts; on systems which don't
even recognize # as signifying a C-shell script, you will also need
to convert C-shell scripts into Bourne shell.
