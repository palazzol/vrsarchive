.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp 1
\fISub\fP is a tool intended to work with \fIcake\fP,
although it may be useful in its own right.
The first two nonoption arguments are name patterns in the sense of
cake(l), except that variables are introduced not by % but by X,
or by the character following \-v if it is given.
.sp 1
Sub matches each name against the old pattern,
setting up the values of its variables,
then prints out the new pattern with those values substituted.
If a name does not match the old pattern, \fIsub\fP prints nothing.
E.g. the command "sub X.c X.o x.c y.h z.c" prints "x.o z.o".
.sp 1
The exit code of \fIsub\fP is the number of unmatched names;
the example above would exit with status code 1.
This can be useful for testing
whether a name comforms to a pattern or not.
However, the \-i option makes \fIsub\fP ignore failed matches;
when given \fIsub\fP will always exit with a zero status.
