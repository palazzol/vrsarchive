This directory contains manuals for cake and its associated commands.

The manuals are named *.1l. They are written for the -man macros
(of course), and are patterned after Pyramid manual pages - I started
writing them while using a Pyramid 90x. You may want to change the
pathnames in cake.1l to match the ones you put in ../conf.h.

The file paper.bib contains a partially preprocessed version of a paper
I wrote on cake; the citation is

%A Zoltan Somogyi
%T Cake: a fifth generation version of make
%J Australian Unix system User Group Newsletter
%K auugn
%V 7
%N 6
%D April 1987
%P 22-31

The file has been put through bib; you should put it through eqn, tbl
and the -me macros.
