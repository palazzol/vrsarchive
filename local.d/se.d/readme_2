Here is the second release of the Georgia Tech Screen Editor, 'se'.
There were enough changes that a whole new posting is warranted.

Major Changes:
	All Georgia Tech specific stuff removed.
	It understands window size changes on 4.3BSD and ATT Unix PC/3B1
	Support for the shared library on the ATT Unix PC/3B1
	Considerable source code reorganization in certain files.

Enjoy,

Arnold Robbins
