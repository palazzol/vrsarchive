This is my current version of a Tektronix previewer for ditroff output.  Any
ditroff output may be processed for (hopefully) all Tektronix 41xx terminal.
This program is different than tc.  tc is written for a 4015 terminal: a
different command set.

This version is far superior to the version posted to the net about 2 months
ago (previously called tk, now ditk).  This version is currently being used 
by secretaries here with great satisfaction.  Fifty page documents are checked 
routinely.  They report no errors.

I wish to thank the following people for their extended efforts:
		Phil Gross
		Paul Magelli
		Paul Pomes

short synopsis: (see also man page)
	supports all sizes of text
	uses hardware character fonts
	special fonts map to ascii equivalent; color changes
	some special characters supported
	line drawing supported
	circle/arc routine included in library; needs testing.
	character slant in library; needs testing.
	forward and backward paging (absolute and relative)
	displays any ditroff output (device independent previewer)
	Tek terminals that it works on (tested): 4107, 4109, 4113
	Tek terminals it should work on: 4111, 4115
	Tek terminals that lose features: 4105 (no zoom & pan)
					  4112 (no color)
	Tek terminals not listed I am unsure of
	certain wide characters (m,w) display narrower on the Tek terms than our
	  laser printer and phototypesetter; thus there may be a gap following
	  these letter.

Hints for performance:
	4105, 07, 09's will run at 38400 baud.  Makes text output fast.

command: ditk [-p#] ditroff.output
		p - page to begin at

To compile set the system type in ditk.c.  See note at top of ditk.c
