.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ditk
[
.BI \-p n
]
{
file
}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ditk
allows previewing of
.IR ditroff (1)
output on the Tektronix 41xx series graphic display terminals.
.PP
Commands:
.PP
To get to the next page wait for the bell then type carriage return.
To get to an absolute page, type the number and a carriage return
after the bell.
To move to a relative page type + or \- followed by the page difference. 
Thus +4 will move 4 pages forward.
4 will move to page 4.
Remember to follow these with a carriage return.
.PP
On the last page a carriage return will exit the program.
On any page a 'q' will terminate the program.
To review all possible commands type '?'.
.PP
Specifying the
.BI \-p n
option will cause
.I ditk
to start on page number
.IR n .
The default is 1.
.SH BUGS

.SH NOTES
.I Ditroff
can be output to any of the following Tektronix terminals:  
.IP
4107, 4109, 4113.
.PP
The following terminals will work but for hardware reasons lose certain
features:
.IN 5
.sp
.nf
4105 - no retained segments, 8 colors
4112 - black and white
.IN -5
.fi
.PP
This program should work on the 4111 and the 4115, however ....
(no guarantees.  See BUGS section above.)
I have made what I believe is the only change necessary to get
.I ditk
to run on a 4115.
It sets the coordinate mode to a 12 bit address instead of the 32 bit
addressing.
It causes an error of level 0 on all other Tek devices.
It most likely won't be apparent. 
The warning begins "Terminal issues message ..." if it appears.
Call it what you want.
.PP
The program sets the fixup level of the Tektronix terminal to level 2.
This allows rapid deletion of the retained page of text.
At the end of 
.I ditk
the fixup level is set back to the default value of
6.
.PP
The features of this program are:
.IP
Complete device independence. 
All output from ditroff is capable of being processed independent
of what device it was intended for.
Naturally somethings aren't perfect.
That's why this is called a previewer.
It is not intended for publications purposes. 
Only to give a good indication of correct form.
It provides a very convenient method of checking for orphans
and widows (lines).  
.IP
Complete character point size mapping.
.IP
Font changes are enabled by changing the color and displaying the ASCII
equivalent.
.IP
Currently only straight line drawing.
The routine for arcs/circles is in the library included but
draws circles starting from the right and proceeding counterclockwise. 
.I Ditroff
likes it from the left.
It may take some playing with.
.IP
Character slant is also possible.
The slant routine is included in ditk.lib.c.
Needs to be played with (see again the BUGS section).
.IP
Complete forward and backward paging.
.SH IMPROVEMENTS
Areas lacking for this program are:
.IP
circles
.sp
character slant
.sp
spline fits
.sp
some special characters
