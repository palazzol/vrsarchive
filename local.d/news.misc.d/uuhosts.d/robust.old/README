This is the source directory for uuhosts, which may be used to
automatically collect map information from mod.map.all and also
to display it to the users.

Unlike the version I posted some time back, this one doesn't have
security problems with extracting things from mod.map.all, and it
can also display UUCP mail paths and USENET map entries faster.
