This is for all those sites that do NOT run 2.10.2 (or better :-) news.
Take the list that spaf presents, and shove it into the script
Update.active.  It strips and cleans it, then allows you to edit
the results, and will then perform 'rmgroup' (included) on the
resulting file.

Edit Mkdead, changing 'sdnet', and 'ca' to reflect your local
groups you want saved.

Try them out bit at a time just to make sure they work.

[You should get 'End of distribution' if you got the whole thing]

Enjoy.....
