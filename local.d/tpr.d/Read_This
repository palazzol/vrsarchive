These are the sources and manual page for tpr, a text formatter based
on roff and translated into C from the version in "Software Tools"
(Kernighan and Plaugher, Addison-Wesley). I have not provided a
makefile as there are only a few files.

	cc -O -o tpr tpr0.c tpr1.c itoeng.c

should work.

Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the inclination these days
to do any more work on this program so you are on your own. But I would
appreciate hearing from you if you do anything interesting with the
sources. Do the net a favour too and post any bug fixes or interesting
modifications you make.

Enjoy. Cheers.
