Comp.Sources.Misc: Volume 2, Issue 5
Submitted-By: Michael J. Young <mjy@sdti.UUCP>
Archive-Name: sys5-fs-analysis

I've tried posting this to comp.sources.unix a number of times (since
October!), but I seem to have discovered a black hole between here and that
newsgroup.  Since I'm starting to get gentle reminders that I'd promised
this awhile ago, I decided to punt and try posting here.

This is a tool that I wrote to determine file system fragmentation on my
Microport box.  I mentioned it a few months ago in comp.unix.wizards, and
got a lot of requests for the source.  It's not very elegant, and it's
specific to System V, but it's functional.

I'd really like to see it ported to other systems (I only have access to
System V).  If anyone has lots of spare time(!)  and wants to port it, there
are some notes in the README file for things to watch out for.  Please send
me your changes so I can incorporate them into my version.  If you are
really bored, feel free to add an in-place disk-compression capability! :-)
