  As a QA engineer (besides other hats I wear ;>) responsible for testing
  our port of SVR4, I am always interested in tests that can "exercise" an
  operating system.

  Crashme gave me an idea to write a similar test program that exercises
  the OS's protection against bad/invalid arguments to system calls.  So
  I whipped one up in short order using some of the code from crashme.
  The program is call tsys, short for "test syscall".  I tried it out on
  a number of systems we have in our lab, and the results were quite inform-
  ative.  I will have to check first to see if I can release the results.
  Sorry, but I don't know much about legal mumbo-jumbo.

  Anyway, here is an early alpha release of tsys.  You are welcome to try
  it out and please email your results (post them too if you wish).  I will
  collect and post the results on a regular basis for those interested.

  I've exchanged email with George Carrette, the author of crashme, and he
  has expressed an interest in integrating tsys into crashme.  I believe
  that will be a useful tool for QA'ing OS.

**** WARNING *****

	Don't say that I have not WARNED you.  I know for a fact that
	tsys (like crashme) can panic (crash) systems from several different
	vendors.  Make sure you do NOT run this on a public machine, or a
	server, or any machine with valuable data!

	Use it at your own risks!
