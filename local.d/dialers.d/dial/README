	This program is in use by us for one phone line
	for dial in and dial out. There might be much better
	solutions to the problem, but the best one is having
	separate phone lines.

	all our uucp and uux calls go with the -r parameter
	and in the /usr/lib/crontab the uucico call is at follows

 05 * * * * /etc/dial out; sleep 5; /etc/dial in

	the program 'chmod' and 'owner' as follows:

 ---s--x--x  1 root        16384 Nov 25 15:42 /etc/dial

I had been doing something similar to this with shell files.
However they left a few things to be desired.  My method here
was to create a lock file when the port was enabled for dial-in.
This served to keep uucp/tip/kermit from trying to use the port
while it was in this mode.  So this creates 4 cases that need
to be checked for.  (read my code and manual page about this).

I also had written a cute little program that made and destroyed
lock files for you.  Very convenient.

Note that I don't follow his suggestion up there of making dial
set-uid.  I don't see where it is terribly safe to let the users
have the power to make lines dial in/out.

As above, the intended use is:

	1:  In the morning, enable 1 or more lines for outgoing.
	    (this actually happens in the wee hours so our news
	    feed gets polled).  Assumption is that most people
	    are in their offices during the day and mostly need
	    the modems to attach to outside computers.
	2:  In the evening, disable some of the outgoing lines
	    leaving 1 or 2 for outgoing.  Not all people are
	    going to be gone, and uucp must still also work.

I have just one line switching back and forth currently.
