	@(#)README	1.1 12/2/84

This is a rewrite of talk to run on System 3/System 5 based systems.
Talk was originally distributed on the net and based on 4.1 mpx files.
It was then picked up by Berkeley and modified to use the 4.2 networking
features and distributed with 4.2.  This is based roughly on the 4.2
version, but with all the network stuff replaced with an implementation
using named pipes for the communication.  Like the early mpx scheme,
this version does not require a talk daemon.
