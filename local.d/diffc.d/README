Subject: contextual diff on Bell systems

This is a program for all those poor slobs that have to deal with UNIX systems
that don't have a -c option on their diff.  This program eliminates the last
excuse for bug fixes to be in standard diff format (especially since "patch"
works so much more reliably on diffc format).

Send bug reports to:  John Nelson  (decvax!genrad!john).
