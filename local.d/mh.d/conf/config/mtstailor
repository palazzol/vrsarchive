#	These look redundant or ill advised:
#
#bbdomain:	UUCP
#hostable:	@(MHETCPATH)/hosts
#mailer:	root
#mmdelim1:	\001\001\001\001\n
#mmdelim2:	\001\001\001\001\n

#systemname:	paris.ics.uci.edu
#tmailqdir:	/usr/tmp
#umincproc:
#
#	These I just did because an example did it:
#
localname:
lockldir:
mmailid:	0
#
#	This is where System V Release 4 puts the SMTP Queues:
#
mailqdir:	/usr/spool/smtpq
#
#	We use gandalf as our local NNTP server:
#
nntphost:	gandalf
#
#	The MMDF interface is surprising in that it copies all the UUCP mail
#	into the MMDF mailbox, then parses *that* into the folder.
#	Setting a directory to null implies the user's home directory.
#	Setting a file to null implies the user's login name.
#	Thus the following specifies that /usr/mail/$USER is to be turned into
#	MMDF mail in $HOME/.mh_mmdf, then $HOME/.mh_mmdf is turned into messages
#	in inbox:
# 
uucpldir:	/usr/mail
uucplfil:
mmdfldir:
mmdflfil:	.mh_mmdf
