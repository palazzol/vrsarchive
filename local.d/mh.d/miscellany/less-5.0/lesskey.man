          _L_e_s_s_k_e_y is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used
          by _l_e_s_s. The input file is a text file which describes the
          key bindings, and the output file is a binary file which is
          used by _l_e_s_s. If no input file is specified, standard input
          is used.  If no output file is specified, $HOME/.less is
          used.

          The input file consists of lines of the form:

               string <whitespace> action <newline>

          Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or
          tabs.  The "string" is the command key(s) which invoke the
          action.  The string may be a single command key, or a
          sequence of up to 15 keys.  The "action" is the name of the
          less action, from the list below.  The characters in the
          "string" may appear literally, or be prefixed by a carat to
          indicate a control key.  A backslash may be used to cause
          the following character to be taken literally.  Characters
          which must be preceeded by backslash include carat, space,
          tab and the backslash itself.  A backslash followed by one
          to three octal digits may be used to specify a character by
          its octal value.  Blank lines and lines which start with a
          pound sign (#) are ignored.

          As an example, the following input file describes the set of
          default command keys used by less:

               k              back-line
               y              back-line

          Commands specified by _l_e_s_s_k_e_y take precedence over the
          default commands.  A default command key may be disabled by
          including it in the key file with the action "invalid".
