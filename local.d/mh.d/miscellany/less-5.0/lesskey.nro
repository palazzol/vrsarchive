.TH LESSKEY 1
.SH NAME
lesskey \- specify key bindings for less
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "lesskey [-o output] [input]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lesskey
is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used by 
.I less.
The input file is a text file which describes the key bindings,
and the output file is a binary file which is used by 
.I less.
If no input file is specified, standard input is used.
If no output file is specified, $HOME/.less is used.
.PP
The input file consists of lines of the form:
.sp
	string <whitespace> action <newline>
.sp
Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs.
The "string" is the command key(s) which invoke the action.
The string may be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15 keys.
The "action" is the name of the less action, from the list below.
The characters in the "string" may appear literally, or be
prefixed by a carat to indicate a control key.
A backslash may be used to cause the following character
to be taken literally.
Characters which must be preceeded by backslash include
carat, space, tab and the backslash itself.
A backslash followed by one to three octal digits may be used to
specify a character by its octal value.
Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign (#) are ignored.

As an example, the following input file describes the set of
default command keys used by less:
