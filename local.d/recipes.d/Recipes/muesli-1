.RH MOD.RECIPES-SOURCE MUESLI-1 B "22 Oct 86" 1987
.RZ "MUESLI" "cold, enriched porridge"
The trouble with buying packaged muesli is that it generally contains salt
and sugar, often in larger quantities than you might choose for yourself.
Making your own muesli is quick and easy, and you can change the ingredients
and alter the proportions to suit yourself.

After a few experiments, I've settled on this recipe:
.IH "4 cups" "2 liters"
.IG "3 cups" "rolled oats" "250 g"
.IG "1 cup" "assorted dried fruit" "100 g"
.IG "1 cup" "bran" "50 g"
.IG "\(14 cup" "sesame seeds" "50 g"
.IG "\(12 cup" "nuts" "75 g"
.IG "\(34 cup" "shelled sunflower seeds" "100 g"
.IG "1 cup" "banana chips" "60 g"

.SK 1
Mix all ingredients together.
.SK 2
Serve (about 5 heaped dessertspoons seems about the right amount) with
milk, cream, yoghurt, or whatever you like on breakfast cereal.  I've
heard that fruit juice is an alternative, but I haven't tried it.
.NX
Use your own choice of dried fruits.  I like to cut 4 or 5 pieces of dried
apricot into slivers, making up the balance with sultanas or raisins.  I 
generally use unsalted peanuts, but I'm sure most nuts would be fine (how
about almonds?).  One word of warning: if you use quick-cooking oats instead
of rolled oats, the result is decidedly mushy.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
5 minutes.

No need to measure.
