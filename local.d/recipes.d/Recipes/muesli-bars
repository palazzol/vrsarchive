.RZ "KYLIE'S MUESLI BARS" "Delicious and nourishing bars for hiking or home"
This is a recipe that my daughter, Kylie, has perfected, starting from one
published in some magazine.  They are ideal to use as trail bars, being both
filling and full of energy, but are also perfect as snacks at home or work.
When on a hard bushwalk, eating these is a real highlight of my day.

.SK 1
Mix the oats, cornflakes, coconut, dried fruit and milk powder together in a
big bowl.
.SK 2
Simmer butter, sugar, honey and peanut butter together for 3 minutes, or
microwave on high for 4 minutes (from cold), stirring every minute.
.SK 3
Pour sauce into dry mixture and mix well.
.SK 4
Press into a biscuit tray and put in refrigerator until cold.  Cut when
cold.
.NX
The bars are best kept in the refrigerator, although it's by no means
essential.  They soften in the heat but don't disintegrate.
.PP
Any other cereal crumbs can be combined with cornflakes to make up the 3
cups. It's a good way to use up those otherwise annoying scraps.  If too
much powdery stuff goes in, the bars can be somewhat dense.  Using Rice
Bubbles (Rice Krispies) gives a lighter texture.
.PP
Dessicated coconut is best, as shredded coconut is too course.
.SH RATING
