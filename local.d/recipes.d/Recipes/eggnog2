.RZ "HOPKINS NEOLITHIC EGG NOG" "Traditional layered eggnog with bourbon and dark rum"
This is the egg nog that was served at the Hopkins Neolithic Xmas Party, a
party that some friends used to have every year. We now serve it for our
Winter Solstice celebration. It's purported to come from the original Fanny
Farmer Cookbook.
