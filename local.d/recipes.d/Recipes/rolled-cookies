I almost never make these cookies except at Christmas time. They just seem
to be Christmas cookies. (I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last
Valentine's day for my then-fiance.) I usually make these cookies in 
Christmas shapes and frost them with green and red frosting. This is a
good recipe for kids to help out with.
