.RZ "AMBROSIA" "Simple desert for failed Pavlova attempts"
My mother used to make the banana variety of this when she cooked
her meringues a little too long or too hot.
I've no idea of its origins.

I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the banana
version.
Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried it.
.PP
This is a neat way of saving a
.IR Pavlova (D)
attempt when the meringue part fails:
it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know...
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
very simple.
.I Time:
10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
.I Precision:
No need to measure.
