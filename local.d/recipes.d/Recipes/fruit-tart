.RZ "FRUIT TART" "A quick fruit tart pie"
This is just about the ideal way to use up any fresh fruit you have lying
around. I got the recipe from my mom.

.IG "2\(12 Tbsp" "cornstarch" "40 ml"

of the fruit in a saucepan with the water, sugar, and cornstarch.
Add another sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon.
Boil until the liquid becomes clear (about two minutes).

Place the remaining fruit in the pie shell, and a sprinkle of the nutmeg
or cinnamon.

Poor the hot mixture over the fruit, and let cool for at least two hours.

.NX
Any fresh fruit in season will do; I've made peach, nectarine, and
strawberry/banana, all to good effect.

Scheduling usually works out well if you make this shortly
before serving the meal, and let it cool while you eat.
