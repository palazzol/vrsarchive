.RZ "MICE" "A quick pear dessert"
In general, a typical
Australian dish is a typical British dish, which is to say a typical European
or American dish with most of the subtleties of flavour (and difficulty in
making) removed.  The following dessert is a genuine Old Family Favorite in
Australia.
.IH "Makes 1 serving"
.IG "2" "pear halves"
Preferably canned (for authenticity), but cooked fresh pear would do.
.IG "2" "blanched almonds"
.IG "" "Angelica"
(Cut two pieces of crystalized (candied) angelica, each
.AB "1/8 inch" "3 mm"
by
.AB "2 inches" "50 mm" ")"
.PH
.SK 1
Carefully halve the almonds along the natural split in the nut.  (This is
easiest after they are still wet from blanching.)
.SK 2
Place the pear halves, round side up, in the serving dish.
.SK 3
At the narrow end of each half, add two almond halves to make mouse ears.  At
the other end, insert the angelica to make a tail.
.NX
Candied angelica is almost impossible to find in North America.  Anything else
with the appropriate properties of sweetness and shape may be substituted,
e.g. a piece of chocolate or candy cut to size, such as an Ovation mint
divided longitudinally.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
2 minutes.
.I Precision:
don't measure, count.
