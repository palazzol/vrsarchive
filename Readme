	This directory contains the local source.  Each Makefile must provide
rules for clean and install, and set ALL.  Things should degenerate cleanly
so that nothing is made on systems where a given program is inappropriate.

	Each Makefile should include /etc/CONFIG.  Sample /etc/CONFIG files are
provided for XENIX, V.3.2, and V.4.0.  CONFIG files have the following
external interfaces:

Imported Macros:
	MODEL	Special flags for compiling and linking 286 binaries
	OPTIONS	Compilation options to be added to CFLAGS
	ALL		A list of the thinks 'make all' should make

Exported Macros:
	SYSNAME	a shell expression that expands to the name of the system
	ROOT	the root directory of the target system
	SAFEUID	is the login name of a relatively safe login.
	SETUID	is the login name for set-uid programs.
	SAFEGRP	is the group name of a relatively safe group.
	CFLAGS	Flags used during compilation and linking of C code
	LIBS	List of libraries for use in linking
	BERKLIB	Special library for BSD compatiblity, if needed
	DIRLIB	Special library for directory manipulation, if needed
	RANLIB	The command to run on newly constructed archives
	PAGER	The program that pages output on this system
	NROFF	The program to convert troff input to printable ascii
	TROFF	The program to convert troff input to printed paper
	CCLIB	A path to place libraries so the C compiler will find them
	NET		A path to place binaries so uux can find them
	ETC		A path for run-time config files read by your binaries
	BINDIR	A path where user interface executables should go
	LIBDIR	A path where support files and executables should go
	INCDIR	A path where local include files should go
	LIBUUCP	The path where UUCP looks for config files
	LIBMAIL	The path where mail looks for config files
	LIBNEWS	The path where news looks for support files and executables
	LIBTMAC	The path where troff looks for macro packages
	GAMDIR	The path where game user interface binaries should go
	GAMLIB	The path where game support files and binaries should go
	SPOOLN	The path where news is spooled
	MAN1	The path where user interface man pages should go
	MAN2	The path where system call man pages should go
	MAN3	The path where library routine man pages should go
	MAN4	The path where file format man pages should go
	MAN5	The path where macro package man pages should go
	MAN6	The path where game man pages should go
	MAN7	The path where device driver man pages should go
	MAN8	The path where system administration man pages should go

Exported Rules:
	An 'all' rule that makes $(ALL)
	A '.c' rule that links C code with $(LIBS)
	Rules that make all the paths exported if they don't already exist
	A '.d' rule that recusrively descends into directories and does a make
