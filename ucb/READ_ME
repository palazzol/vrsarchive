  This directory contains XENIX versions of utilities which exist
on 4.1 Berkeley Unix systems.  Most of these programs are stolen
from omsvax, with portability improvements to get them to run.

  In some cases the code is extensively rewritten, particuluarly
programs like `w.c', which access information in mem and kmem.

  A companion directory, /usr/src/local, contains source for commands 
which are locally developed or are developed from material in the
public domain.  The intent is that this directory contain licensed
materials and that /usr/src/local contain material free of license
requirements.
