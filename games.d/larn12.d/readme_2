Larn, version 12.0 is now being posted to the net.  Larn is a dungeon type game,
you against the machine, that is similar to rogue and hack, but with a different
approach.  Many things have been changed from version 11; here are some of them:

- Larn can now use termcap.  Larn should now be able to run on any terminal.
- Playerid's instead of userid's are now supported for scoreboard entries.
- Some monsters move with the intelligent monster movement method.  This makes
	some of those beasties very hard to get away from.
- The spell "gen" has been implemented.
- savefilenames can now be specified in the larnopts file
- no-beep option has been added
- Miscellaneous items can now be sold in the store.
- Spelling errors have been corrected.

as well as bug fixes, and other changes.  Consult the file "Fixed.Bugs" for
the complete change list.

James D. McNamara (harvard!bu-cs!jim) has volunteered to keep organized
any bugs and patches that larn may need.  Bug reports, source or patch
requests can be directed to Jim or myself (panda!condor!noah), and we'll try
to respond promptly.

Thanks to all of you who helped out in describing problems, and for the ideas
to augment the wish list.  I am planning another round of enhancements sometime
this fall.  For the moment though, 12.0 will the latest version available.

			Happy Larning!
