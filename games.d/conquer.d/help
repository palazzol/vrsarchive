                           WELCOME TO CONQUER

CONQUER is a multi player computer game designed to run under the UNIX 
operating system.  In CONQUER,  each player is the leader of a nation, 
composed of people (humans, orcs, elves, dwarves), recourses, and land.  
Rulers customize their nation at creation by chosing their race and by giving 
their nation special powers (magic, combat factor, location, speed...)
and resources (civilians, troops, iron, gold...).  Play involves building, 
moving, and controlling armies and navies, diplomacy with other players, 
and adjusting economic activity, which is primarily geared to the production 
of gold for your treasury.  Iron is needed, however to build ships & armies, 
and food is needed to prevent revolts and keep people alive.  

Command line format: conquer [-maxhps -nNAT -dDIR]  
       -m       make a world                    -a       add new player
       -x       execute program                 -h       print this help text
       -n NTN   run as nation NTN               -p       print map of world
       -d DIR   run on data in directory DIR    -s       print out scores

It is suggested that each player set up an alias for their game & nation.

                                THE WORLD

The Conquer world is very bloody, and a player needs skills at war gaming,
diplomacy, and building an economy to succeed.  Rival races are constantly 
at war, and the world starts filled with player nations, random peoples
(lizard men in their cities of gold, barbarians, nomads, pirates, brigands),
and both hostile and friendly computer controlled non player countries.
Conquer can be played solitaire.  The computer uses an highly intelligent
movement algorithm to run the armies and navies of these non player
nations, and has intelligent algorithms built in that control these nations
diplomacy, construction, and economies.  You can find NPCs allied with 
you against a common enemy,  but can also suddenly be stabbed in the 
back and find hostile NPC armies at your doorstep.
END
                     WHAT IS WHAT IN THE WORLD

The world is composed of a 2 dimensional map of sectors, created by the 
computer at the beginning of the game.  Each sector has about 10 unique 
characteristics (altitude, gold, vegetation...).   

SECTOR ELEVATIONS include:        WATER    '~'        PEAK     '#' 
                MOUNTAIN '^'      HILL     '%'        CLEAR    '-' 

SECTOR VEGETATION
Uninhabitable Areas (do not produce food and people simply do not like)
     VOLCANO   'V'        DESERT 'D'     JUNGLE  'J'
     WASTE     'W'        ICE 'I'        SWAMP  'S'

Inhabitable (people like, number is relative value of food production)
     LIGHT VEGETATION         '6'         GOOD   '9'     FOREST   '3'
     WOOD                     '7'         BARREN '4'

CONQUER is designed so each race likes their appropriate terrain.  Elves 
like woods & forests,  Humans like good & light vegetation, and Orcs and 
Dwarves like hills and mountains.
END
                             RACES OF THE WORLD

ORC      'O'    Poor at combat but they reproduce like mad (they can go over 
                10% reproduction ceiling). Orcs are lousy fighters and are 
                led by minor monsters (they start with MINOR MONSTER power).
ELF       'E'   Great at defense and quick, but few in numbers.  They start 
                with VOID power, which is perhaps the most potent power in the 
                game, but which costs them an extra distribution point.  
DWARF     'D'   Dwarves are good at combat, but slow and few in numbers.  They
                start with MINER power, which allows them to quickly mine 
                iron/jewels, and thus build up their combat skills and powers.
HUMAN     'H'   Humans start average at everything -- with reasonable numbers,
                of people, and WARRIOR power, which gives them +10% in combat.
                They have OK reproduction and good movement.
LIZARD    'L'   (NPC only)  An ancient race bound to their cities of gold 
PIRATE    'P'   (NPC only)  Wandering pirates/brigands intent on plunder
NOMAD     'N'   (NPC only)  Will the wandering nomads tribes leave you alone?
BARBARIAN 'B'   (NPC only)  Indigenous natives

CITY       'c'   Cities and Capitols are the bases of your power.  They
CAPITOL    'C'   are the only places you can draft armies or construct 
                 ships. Drafting only works if the sectors people is
                 greater than your total civilians divided by the quantity
                 16+(number of sectors)/2.  Cities give 750 talons per
                 person and Capitols give 1000 talons per person. Cities and
                 Capitols cost more to redesignate.  To capture an 
                 unoccupied city/capitol, you must be the only occupant when
                 the world is updated.

                        POSSIBLE ARMY STATUS

MARCH   :Marching doubles army movement at the expense of combat strength.
SCOUT   :Scouts avoid any enemy, if possible, and can move through hostile
        :   armies, but must have less than 25 men per army and can not take
        :   even unowned land.  They are useful to check out the  map and
        :   to determine the enemy combat strength.  You must draft scouts
        :   as you can not split scouts from an army.
ATTACK  :Armies in this mode can take owned sectors, initiate
        :   combat, and have they reasonable movement rates.
DEFEND  :In this mode, can take owned sectors and have good defense 
        :   and movement, but can not initiate combat.
GARRISON:This mode offers the strongest defense but is used only in cities
        :   and castles.  Garrisons may not move.

Note: It takes 75 men to take a sector.  Your attack bonus increases by 
        5% if you take over a non player country. 
END
                              NON PLAYER NATIONS 

Diplomacy with non player nations is important in this game.  This determines  
if you get attacked or not.  

use your gold talons to bribe non player countries that are at war with
        you.  It may not work, but may allow you some breathing room and 
        at some point the gold becomes irrelevant anyway.

you had best not be at war with NPCs when you bribe them.  If you are,
        you have just wasted your money.
END
                           ADDITIONAL NOTES ON COMBAT

Losses per unit are inversely proportional to a units combat bonus.

You can expect to take several turns to reduce a large army, especially
        on a City or Capitol.  NPC defenders will draft new troops each turn

The only method to take an occupied City or Capitol is to be the the only
        army in the sector when the combat is *over*.

Ships are more powerful than you might expect.  They permit rapid relocation of
	armies & civilians to strategic points.  Their movement is 3x that of
        a land army and they pay 1 move point per sector (coast lands) and
	4 move points in deep water. Naval combat has not been play tested.

THE NEXT PAGE IS THE COMBAT RESULTS TABLE                        
        basically the attacker wants a high roll and the defender wants low.

                          RULES ON IRON, FOOD, AND GOLD

FOOD:      You MUST have enough food to feed your people... One civilian eats 
        one unit of food, and one soldier eats two units.  If you run out of 
        food, half the difference of people in cities die.  Your Granary
        will store 3x your civilian population in food.  The remainder 
        is converted to gold talons at a rate of 1 per food point.
IRON:      You need to have iron to draft new military.  Ten iron units
        will suffice to equip one soldier.  You also need 200 gold talons to 
        train a soldier. One person produces one iron per point of mineral in 
        the sector per turn.  An amount of Iron (based on the number of troops 
        you have) can be used to buy +1% in attack or defense.
JEWELS:    You can have a maximum of 10 talons debt for every jewel
        point that you mined.  After that point, you undergo a TAX REVOLT,
        which has not yet been implemented. Thus gold can be negative to 
        a certain level.  Jewels are also used in magic, and 100000 Jewels
        will buy you one random new power (command M) (it doubles for each
        power though).  You can have 10 talons in the treasury for each jewel 
	(gold based economy).  After that, your gold talons will be converted 
	to jewels at a 10:1 ratio.

                        FINAL HINTS

It is important to buy a reproduction rate of 9-10% percent.

Extra movement is very useful (especially if your movement is 6)

Buy civilians instead of military (who don't reproduce).  This assumes
        that you have a military of about 1500 men for taking land.

Take as much land as possible in the beginning.

Make sure your combat bonus is respectable.

DONE
