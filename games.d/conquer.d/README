			NOTES TO INSTALLER OF CONQUER

What you have here is a copyrighted release 2 version version of CONQUER.  
I make no guaranties to the sanity or style of this code, but do believe
that it should work as documented.  I have included numerous bugfixes
from the release 1 posting, and have added numerous enhancements. 

One note.  I am probably going to switch jobs soon.  My current email
address is {ihnp4}!mhuxd!smile, but this will change.  I recommend that
anybody interested in corresponding with me send me *their* address
so I can inform them of my new address when I get one.  If your mail
bounces, my home phone is 201-671-2896 and *current* work phone is
201-949-4407.  Note that I only work on Conquer out of work hours.

Included in this file are the following:

	1) A Brief Description of Conquer
	2) Installation (unpacking) Instructions
	3) Configuration Instructions
	4) Compilation Instructions
	5) Administration instructions
	6) Execution instructions (how to play)
	7) A list of further enhancements I am planning on making
	8) Bug list and unimplemented options

This version should not be redistributed and probably has bugs.  
Any comments and bug reports would be appreciated.

-----------------------------------------------------------
I   A Brief Description of Conquer
-----------------------------------------------------------

READ FILE "man.page" FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CONQUER.  A more complete
description can be found in the file "help". The help file can be
read in nice format by using "conquer -h" after compilation.
Hard copy of documentation can be made by typing "make docs".

-----------------------------------------------------------
II  Installation (unpacking) Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

This program came in 5 shar scripts, which can be unpacked
by using "sh filename".  If you are reading this, you know this.

If you suspect missing files, please check the MANIFEST.

-----------------------------------------------------------
III Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------

THE FOLLOWING FILES SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT YOUR ENVIRONMENT
AND THE TYPE OF GAME YOU WISH TO PLAY.

header file: header.h modify as per instructions
             data.h   probably needs no modifications
makefile: Makefile    modify as per instructions
          main.c      probably needs no modifications

I have tried to comment this stuff appropriately.

-----------------------------------------------------------
IV  Compilation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Browse the file header.h.  This sets up configurable parameters for the
game.  This program should be easy to compile. 

- Sometimes termcap/termlib... are not on systems.  You will know this
    is the error if all the '.c' files compile but will not compile together.
    Unreferenced symbol errors will occur.  Try adding "-ltermcap" after
    the "-lcurses" line in the makefile.

-----------------------------------------------------------
V   administration instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have compiled it, this is how you administer the game.
I recommend following these instructions once yourself in a mock game 
(ie. no other players) for a few turns to get things straight.  Then you 
can add other players.

You can type the following commands to help administer the game

Make:		Compiles the code.
Make clobber:   Clobber everything but the source (destroys executable)
Make clean:     Clean up objects (does not destroy executable)
Make install:	Installs executable & data in appropriate directories (header.h)
Make docs:	Creates documentation from help file
run:		read this file, it permits you to run the update automatically
		run needs to be modified for time to update

This is the command line format for conquer:
	Cmd line format: conquer [-maxhp]
		(no options) play the game
		-m  make a world ('data' file must not exist, need god password)
		-a  add new player (must know god password)
		-x  execute program (must know god password)
		-p  print a map to stdout (must know god password)
                -h  Print out help text.
                -n  NTN Run as nation NTN.
                -d  DIR Run on data in directory DIR.  Each game has its own 
                    data directory.  The default is set up at compile time and 
                    should only be used if only one game is run.
                 -s Print out scores of all nations in the world.

Again, prior to the compile, you should have followed the instructions
in the Makefile and in header.h.  

First, make a directory in which to play the game.  You should then
move the nations and help files into the target directory.

Then create the world via:
	<conquer -m>    this will make your world.  Try it.
			 This also sets up npc nations as per the nations file
			 npc stats can be adjusted by editing nations
			 prior to making the world.  Non player nations have
			 the same password as god.

Add 0 or more players via
	<conquer -a>    which should be self explanatory


Learn the commands (Type '?' to get help) & play around to get your 
syntax right.

Try logging in as either a player or non player nation (they use the super
user password) and noticing any differences.

Now move around on the map and learn where the players are
positioned.  If there is a problem (they are surrounded by water...), 
use the redesignate command to change elevation or vegetation. 
In the worst case, god can destroy a nation
with 'c', the change nation command.  Once you
think the game will be fair, it is time to allow players to proceed.

Now you are all set -- play via 
	<conquer>

and update with <conquer -x> via 
an "at" script. This is contained in the shell script "run".

VI a list of further enhancements/bug fixes I am planning on making
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Trade is unimplemented
Naval combat and movement has not been system tested
Only one type of soldier and one type of warship allowed (see data.h)
Character Classes and leaders are not fully implemented
