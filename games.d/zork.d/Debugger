Summary: incant,

Gdt is the game debugging tool in unix zork.  To get into it, type
"gdt" to the game.  It then gives you a 6-char sequence.  Suspend
your zork session, start up another one, and type "incant, XXXXXX" to
the new one, where XXXXXX is the sequence given by the first one.
It will respond with YYYYYY.  Exit the new zork game, restart the first
one, and type YYYYYY (given by the other game) as a response to the XXXXXX
query.  This puts you into the debugger, and lets you enter and leave the
debugger at will with no further passwords.  Typing "HE" to the GDT> prompt
will give you a brief summary of commands available within GDT.
