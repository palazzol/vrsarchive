I've been attempting to put together a canonical listing of all of the hints
and spoilers available to mankind in his quest for the amulet.

Gurus:  If you don't see your special hint, or if any information is not
totally true, please e-mail me.  I'll collect hints and spoilers and
probably post every two months or so.

Others:  If you are not sure that you want to learn all of the deep, dark
secrets of the game, please hit your "n" key now.


This is hackhints.  It is a collected list of spoilers and hints that I
started about a month ago.  Some of these hints are direct pull-downs from
the net, and the credit goes to the respectful authors.  Any listing that
does not have an author is based on my own experiences in the dungeon.

Read on, adventurer, and happy hacking.  -JT

Hell hints:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hell is where the heart is.

To get to hell (and the bunker, the amulet, the hell hound, and the dog),
you need the following:

1.  Scroll of teleportation
2.  Method of getting confused (potions of confusion, booze, dead bat, 
	dead stalker)
3.  Ring of Teleport Control
4.  Fire Resistance (dead dragon or ring)

Get confused, read the scroll, and you will be asked what level to teleport
to.  In 1.02 (and 1.03 I believe), the highest possible is level 39.  If you 
type a higher number, you still wind up on level 39.  In the center of the
level is a bunker surrounded by a moat with the wizard (1) and hell hound in
it (d).  Cross the water (wand of fire, levitate, or enormous rock into the
water), dig your way through the bunker (find the closest m if you don't
have a wand or a pick-axe), and kill the wizard.  Next work your way up the
maze levels.  Each one has a wand of wishing under an immobile rock (note
that on 1.02 at least, level 39 does not have a wand of wishing).  If you
want, collect turn enormous rocks into rocks & polymorph into gems on your
way up also.  

E(ngraving) Elbereth will protect you from monsters.  Doing it with a wand
of fire will take a turn and allow you to attack monsters for several turns
while they do not attack you.  1.02 allows you to through weapons from an
elbereth, 1.03 does not.  Both allow wands and the a(pply) of a pick-axe
through an elbereth as an attack.

The following lists may be of some use:  they include official names (1.02
and 1.03), gem values, and effects of confused scrolls, thrown potions and
the like.  They're collected off the net, but unfortunatly I can't give
credit to the compilers since I've deleted the headers.  

Happy hacking!

Hack strips out s's, es's, etc. so don't worry about them.
Hack does not care if it is upper or lower case.
You can wish for up to 3 of an item.
You can wish for an up to +3 item.
If you wish for >+3 you get +0.
If you wish for >+3 and your luck is < 0 you will get -3.

Some wand tricks:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are playing v1.02 and you have a wand of polymorph:
lay wands out in front of you like this
            ----------
            |........|
            |/////@..|
            |........+
            ----------
and zap the wand of polymorph over them.  peruse the wands after each zap and
pick up useful wands (wishing, polymorph, digging, whatever) continuing to zap
until you have everything you need.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use wands of wishing until they are (-1) charges.  Lay them out and zap with a
wand of cancellation.  The wand returns to (0) charges, and another charge can
be "wrested out of this worn-out wand".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In dealing with monsters such as unicorns, remember that ray wands "bounce" 
off the wall.  A wand of sleep does nicely in cases like these.  It also works
on shopkeepers.

Scare monster is one of the best scrolls in the dungeon for morgues and
zoos.  Its proper use is to drop it on the floor and fight from it:  the
monsters will not attack you.  In effect, it is the same as an 'Elbereth'
engraved with a wand of fire except that the effects don't end after 10
turns (or whatever the correct amount is).  This can only be done once which
is why the scrolls turn to dust on trying to pick them up again.  Whenever
in a scroll shop, be sure to have enough room in the knapsack to pick up
every scroll there, otherwise trying to pick it up will result in the scroll
becoming dust after you make room for it.


	Hi all,
		I still like what happened to me once. After walking into a  
shop with a ring of conflict on the shopkeeper killed all the monsters in the 
room. After robbing him blind I telported out figuring that was that. But no
he found me and kept asking if I forgot to pay. When ever we got near a monster
he just bobed them on the head. I was able to take him down 4-5 levels before
he got himself killed.

Some of the rings can be identified by using them.

	Ring of levitation
	Ring of teleportation (if not eaten leprechaum)
	Ring of fire resistance (Find a Dragon)
	Ring of cold resistance (Find a Freezing spere)
	Ring of poison resistance (Find a killer bee)
	Ring of teleport control (If teleport ability)
	Ring of see invisible (Find an Invisible stalker)
	Ring of agravate monster (Find a Nymph)
	Ring of conflict 

Hope that they are not cursed.

Erkki

	Ring of poison resitnace (Find a killer bee)

Weapons and such:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thats right!  +11 weapons and more!  Read on to discover the secret!

Of course, you don't have to read this and it might be considered a bug...
Not everyone knows that you can identify the potion of sickness using the
#dip command.  If you version has this command, type #dip, enter the
weapon you want the dip and then the potion you want to dip into.  This
covers the weapon with the potion, using up the potion, and puts the affect
of the potion on the weapon.  The trick is that ONLY potions of sickness
are affected. (Perhaps this potion is an oil and is the only type that
will stick to the weapon.)  The other trick is that it only works on
arrows and bolts but not on darts.  I haven't tried it on other weapons.
The effect of #DIPping a bunch of arrows into a potion of sickness is the
potion get used up and the arrows get an extra +1.  This works  even if the 
arrows and potion are not identifyed.  This is a simple way of identifying 
the sickness potion.

Now for the +11 weapon.  I describe this method to a freind and she used it
on a batch of 20 arrows.  In fact, she used it 12 times (she drank one, opps).
She now had 20 +11 arrows.  This was her +11 weapon.  She did shoot some, but
tended to wield them so as not to lose them.  When she told me about them
I checked her inventory.  Yes, she had a wand of polymorph! 
We dropped the arrows in a line in stacks of 1 arrow each and zapped the 
line of arrows with the wand.  Well, she eventually died (happens to the best
of us) but somewhere in our dungeon lies her ghost with a +11 two handed sword
and two +11 daggers and a +11 spear ....


Special names:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elbereth:
	(E)ngraved on the floor, this becomes a safe place to regain hit 
points.  In version 1.02 you can also (a)pply your pick axe to kill monsters
and you can also (t)hrow weapons, such as the use of bow and arrow.

Croesus:
	When in a vault, sometimes a guard will enter and as your name.  Enter
Croesus, and he'll leave.

Orcrist:
	Used on two-handed swords in some versions, all weapons in other 
versions, it adds to the amount of damage done to Orcs.

Special commands:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#dip:
	(#d)ip arrows, shurikens, darts, etc in potions of poison.  If
unidentified potion is suspected to be poison, upon dipping the weapon
will be plussed and the potion will disappear.

#pray:
	I have yet to find a use for this.

Special weapons:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wearing gloves and wielding a dead cockatrice.
A two handed sword called Orcrist.
Dipped arrows, shurikens, darts, etc can be plussed beyond the legal limit
	for scrolls of enchant (+3).

Special tricks:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along with polymorphing wands, you can polymorph just about anything.  Breaking
up rocks and polymorphing the piles yields gems.  Identify the gems until you
have piles of 255 of each, cursed and uncursed.

Dipping weapons, like arrows, until you have +12 or so, then polymorphing until
you have two handed sword or crysknife.
