Here is a game that I wrote myself!  And it even has a doc.
Bugs to me.  I am still supporting this.  I have seen it work
on a vax, pyramid and even a sun all running 4BSD.  I have no idea
about sys V.  Keep me informed.  		--ed

To install the game:

	make makesrc
	vi dist/tunable.c	# Tailor SPECIAL_DIR to atc library directory
	vi Makefile		# Change DESTINATION to your games directory
				# and change OWNER to your standard games uid
	make install
