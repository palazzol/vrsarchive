To quote from the README file in the Hershey font distribution:

>Additional Work To Be Done (volunteers welcome!):
>	- Write a banner-style program using Hershey Fonts for input and
>		non-graphic terminals or printers for output.

I had yet to see such a program, so I wrote it myself, and herewith
present the fruit of my labors to the banner-hungry denizens of Usenet.

Included in this package are:
	1) this file (README),
	2) a Makefile,
	3) the hbanner.c program source,
	4) mk_font, a shell script for translating the hershey database
into an hbanner database.

I assume that you have the hershey font distribution, including:
	1) hersh.oc[1234],
	2) all of the occidental translation tables (*.hmp) in the same
directory as hersh.oc[1234].

If you don't have the hershey fonts, they are available from the
mod.sources archive (sources-request@mirror.uucp).  Please do not post
requests for hershey fonts to net.sources!

I also assume that you have a 132-column line printer.

To configure hbanner, you must first edit the Makefile, setting these
two variables:

	HERSHDIR= <the directory where the hersh.oc? & *.hmp files reside>
	FONTDIR= <the directory where you want the hbanner font files to go>

After you run make, you may begin to compile the font database.  The
mk_font shell script is invoked thusly:

	mk_font <fontname> &

where fontname is the root of the name of any of the *.hmp files in
HERSHDIR.  I suggest running this in the background, as it will take a
number of minutes.

Once you have an hbanner font file, you are ready to make a banner.
Surely you can think of SOMETHING that deserves to be printed in GIANT
letters?

	hbanner <fontname>
	Fee, fie, foh, fum; I smell the blood of an Englishman!
	^D

Note that hbanner with no arguments will print a list of the available
fonts.

If you have any trouble with this beastie, or if you thought of a better
way to do it, by all means contact me.
