			 Welcome to Centipede!

    The object of this game is to survive as long as you can and get as many
points as possible. You are situated in a strange garden, and there are
different forms of life there. The main part of the game is the centipede,
which starts up on the top of the screen, and moves across, coming down when it
hits something. There are many mushrooms scattered about, blocking your way.
You can shoot these 3 times to destroy them. There are other creatures such
as fleas, scorpions, and spiders. You have to hit fleas twice to destroy them.
    You get 1 shot. You can fire again as soon as hits something, or after it
goes off the top of the screen. You are represented on the screen by an
exclamation point (!), and your shot by an asterisk (*). Anything that moves
on the screen can kill you, so be careful. You start off with 3 men (lives),
and get a free man for every 12,000 points that you score. You can move within
the region on the bottom of the screen below the horizontal dashes.
    If you just want to see the high score list, start the game with the -s
flag, i.e. cent -s. You can save your game at any time by pausing with the
<tab> key, and then typing s. To restore a saved game, start the game with the
savefile as an argument, i.e. cent savefile. Warning: do not do anything to a
saved game file, or you will not be able to restore the game. When the game
is paused, you can save your game as described earlier, or redraw the
screen by typing ^L.
    Other details of the game you will find out by playing.

	Controls: (default)
	<space>                 fire                           On an H19,
	   1                    move left                 the movement commands
	   3                    move right                can be made using the
	   .                    move down                 lower 12 keys of the
	   5                    move up                   numeric keypad.

	   0                    move down and left
	<enter>                 move down and right
	   7                    move 8 spaces to the left
	   9                    move 8 spaces to the right
	 <tab>                  make the game pause
	   ^L                   redraw the screen (only while paused)
	   s                    save the game (only while paused)
	   ^C                   quit
	   ^Z                   stop the game temporarily
	   ^\                   emergency quit (if all else fails)

	To satisfy your own idea of what the controls for this game should be,
	you can define your own characters to represent the movement commands
	by using the environment variable CENTOPTS. This variable should contain
	a string of the form "opt1,opt2,...,optn", where each opti is a string
	of the form "cmdname=char", where cmdname is the name of the command
	whose character you are defining, and char is the character you want to
	associate the named command with. E.g., my CENTOPTS variable might
	contain "fi=2", to set the character representing the command to fire to
	'2', and to actually set the variable, I would type
		% setenv CENTOPTS "fi=2"
	The names of the characters and the commands they represent are:
	   up = up        ri = right     dl = downleft   fl = fastleft
	   do = down      ul = upleft    dr = downright  fr = fastright
	   le = left      ur = upright   fi = fire       pa = pause
	It is advisable not to define the same character to be associated
	with two different commands, for obvious reasons.
	(Note: you cannot specify space, tab or newline as the character
	for a command (though carriage return is ok). As mentioned already,
	space and tab are the default characters for fire and pause, but
	they cannot be used for any other commands.)

	Scoring:
	   O                    centipede head          100
	   o                    centipede body          10
	   P p . X x ,          mushroom                1
	   @                    flea                    200
	`oo'--/                 scorpion                1,000

	 /\  /\                                        /300
	 /\oo/\                 spider                < 600
						       \900
    

	Load average checking is done by the game automatically.
	Whenever the (five minute) load average rises above the
	maximum allowed (4.0), you will be informed. At this point
	you have 2 minutes to quit/save your game before it is
	forceably ended. If the load drops, you are permitted to
	continue.


			Good luck!
