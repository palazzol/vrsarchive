You should have the files:
install.doc - This file
cent.doc - A file describing how to play.
sys_dep.c - A C file with system dependent constants.
sys_dep.h - A C header file with definitions of default movement commands
makefile - The makefile for compilation

Other source files:
cent.h cent.c extern.c input.c interrupts.c la.c move.c options.c 
save.c score.c shoot.c stuff.c


You should look at sys_dep.{c,h} and modify the constants there to suit
your system. Then just run make to compile the program.

Note: the score file should be protected 666, and it is assumed that
the file exists when the program is run. Hence you should create an empty
file under the name given in sys_dep.c initially.

One way to insure that there will be no tampering with the score file
is to make a directory which is protected 711, giving only execute access.
Within this directory make another subdirectory with protection 777, and in
here put the score file, and define (in sys_dep.c) the lockfile to be a file
in here. The lockfile is assumed not to exist at the beginning. The purpose
of the lockfile is to ensure exclusive access to the scorefile. (E.g.,
/usr/games/lib/cdir is protected 711, and contains other subdirectories,
one containing a score file, one for the lockfiles. This directory could
also contain cent.doc.)
