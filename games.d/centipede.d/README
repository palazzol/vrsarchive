Centipede is based on the video game by the same name which has been
around for many years. It is a real-time 'video' game for standard
character terminals on Unix machines.

The game was written for 4.1bsd Unix, and has recently been tested
on 4.2. No guarantees are made for any other versions, though I'd
be interested in hearing about what happens.

Among other features, the game allows for saving/restoring, has load
average restrictions, and keeps a high score list. 

Sorry, there is no 'man page' available. A help file is available from
within the game.

Edit the file 'sys_dep.c' to adjust pathnames for your particular system.

I wrote this game about four years ago, and (after a couple of recent
modifications) decided it was time that I share it with other Usenet
game players. I'm not too keen on keeping track of tons of bugs, but
for the time, feel free to report whatever you want to me at one of
the mail addresses below.
