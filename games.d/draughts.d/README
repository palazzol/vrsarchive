This is a dam/continental checkers/jeu de dames/draughts playing
program. It adheres accurately to the international rules
(so don't think the program is wrong in case your friends taught
you the game differently).
I wrote this in the times that int was the only data type
and converted it today to something that passes the C compiler
and leaves lint reasonably happy.
People with more spare time could make the program more useful
and more portable by
1. Rewriting prbord.c to use TERMCAP ; right now it only works
   on a hp2640a or on a hardcopy terminal.
2. Rewriting pmesg() to use sprintf() to avoid varargs problems.
Good luck!
