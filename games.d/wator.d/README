This program is based on the December 1984 Scientific American
Computer Recreations feature by A. K. Dewdney.

The program is somewhat like "life".  The screen displays a grid
in which sharks and fish exist.  Both move at random.  Sharks eat
the fish.

Note that I have only run this under 4.2, but have put in some
ifdef's (FOUR2) to aid non 4.2 systems.  To extract, save
this as "wator.src", place in an empty directory, edit and remove
from beginning through line marked "cut here".  Trim end of file
as necessary.  Extract as: "sh wator.src".  Then "make".
If you make enhancements (or bug fixes) send me mail.
