This article consists of some fixes to problems mailed to me
since trek73 has been posted.  The source files included here
should replace their original couterparts.

Bugs fixed include:
	parsit.c - a fix that I had long ago thought corrected
		is in the loop that frees up the array.  SYSV
		and BSD handle this loop differently.  This fix
		should clear up segmentation violations that
		occur upon typing the second command.
	save.c - Some of the BSD-specific things have ben fixed.
		It may not work the same, and for that I apologize.
		I culled the save routines from rogue.
	Makefile - Fixed and added stuff so parsit should compile
		correctly.
