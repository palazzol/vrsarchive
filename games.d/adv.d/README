For some reason, this stuff resurfaced recently, and I decided to
clean it up a little and post it.  What it is is the original Scott
Adams adventure, "Adventure Land", and Alexis Adams' "Pirate's
Adventure".  These were published long ago in Creative Computing,
in (ugh) BASIC.  One of the first things I wrote in C was something
to do a similar job.  I also transcribed the data files for the
two adventures.  (By the way, I should mention that I use a sort
of adventure compiler to turn a slightly more readable source
format into the data files given here.)

The code is quite old, and there are a lot of things I would do
differently if I were to really rewrite it, but it does work.  You
will need the Maryland Windows package (by yours truly) to run it.
(I originally used curses, but the display update was just too
painful.  I imagine it could be converted back without too much
effort.)

(Manual entry?  What manual entry?)
