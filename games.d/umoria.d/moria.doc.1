             MORIA

                           MORIA
          player  may  choose  from  a  number  of  races  and classes when
          creating their character, and then 'run' that  character  over  a
          period of days, weeks, even months; attempting to win the game by
          defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.

               The player will begin his adventure on the town level  where
          he  may  acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by
          bartering with various shop  owners.   After  preparing  for  his
                                                                      MORIA
          where fantastic adventures await his coming!

               Before beginning your first adventure, you should read  this
                                           MORIA
          will require a dedicated player to win.








               ___ _________

               All characters have six main attributes which  modify  their
          basic   abilities.   These  six  attributes,  called  stats,  are
          STRENGTH,  INTELLIGENCE,  WISDOM,  DEXTERITY,  CONSTITUTION,  and
          CHARISMA.   Stats  may  vary  from  3 as a minimum to 18/100 as a
          maximum.  Because adventurers of interest tend to be better  than
                               MORIA
          further  adjusted  by  race  and  class.   Some  races  are  just
          naturally  better  at  being  certain  classes,  as will be shown
          later.

               In addition to the more visible stats,  each  character  has
          certain  abilities  which  are  mainly determined by his race and
          class, but are also modified by his  stats.   The  abilities  are
          FIGHTING,   THROWING/BOWS,   SAVING  THROW,  STEALTH,  DISARMING,
          MAGICAL DEVICES, PERCEPTION, SEARCHING, and INFRA-VISION.

               Characters will be assigned an early history, with money and
          a social class based on that history.  Starting money is assigned
          based on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the  average  of  a
          character's  stats.   A  character  with below average stats will
          receive extra money to help him survive the first adventure.

               Each character will also have physical attributes such as  a
          race, a height, weight, sex, and a physical description.  None of
          these, except weight, play any part in the  game  other  than  to
          give  the  player  a "feeling" for his character.  Weight is used
          for computing carrying capacity and also for BASHING.

               Finally each character is assigned HIT POINTS based on their
          race,  class,  and constitution.  Spell casters will also receive
          "MANA" which is expended when casting spells.  MANA is  based  on
          Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


          2.1.1  Character Stats -


          STR - Strength

               Strength is important in fighting with weapons, or  hand  to
          hand.   A  high strength can improve your chances of hitting, and
          the amount of damage done with each  hit.   Characters  with  low
          strengths  may  receive  penalties.   Strength  is also useful in
          tunneling, body and shield bashing, and in the carrying of  heavy
          items.


          INT - Intelligence

               Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage,  or  magician.   A
          high  intelligence  increases a mages chances of learning spells,
          and in gaining mana.  No spell  may  be  learned  by  mages  with
          intelligences  under 8.  Intelligence also modifies a character's
          chance of disarming traps and picking locks.


          WIS - Wisdom

               Wisdom is the  prime  stat  of  a  priest.   A  high  wisdom
          increases  the  chance  of  receiving  new spells from a priest's
          diety, and in the  gaining  of  mana.   Wisdom  also  modifies  a
          character's  chance  of  resisting  magical  spells cast upon his
          person.


          DEX - Dexterity

               Dexterity is the combination of agility  and  quickness.   A
          high  dexterity  may allow a character to get multiple blows with
          lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and  may
          increase  his  chances  of hitting with any weapon.  Dexterity is
          also useful in picking locks and disarming traps.


          CON - Constitution

               Constitution is a characters ability  to  resist  damage  to
          their  body,  and  to  recover from damage received.  Therefore a
          character with a high constitution will receive more hit  points,
          and be more resistant to poisons.


          CHR - Charisma

               Charisma represents a character's personality,  as  well  as
          physical  looks.   A  character with a high charisma will receive
          better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a  very
          low  charisma  will  be  robbed blind.  A high charisma will also
          mean more starting money for the character.

          2.1.2  Character Sex -

               You may choose to be either a male or  a  female  character.
          Only height and weight are affected by a character's sex.  Female
          characters tend to be somewhat smaller  and  lighter  then  their
          male counterparts.  No adjustments to stats or abilities are made
          because of the sex of a character.

          2.1.3  Character Abilities -

               Characters possess nine different abilities which  can  help
          them to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based
          upon race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by  high  or  low
          stats, and may increase with the level of the character.


            - Fighting

               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
          fists.   Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon,
          but if his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive
          more   blows  per  round  with  lighter  weapons.   Strength  and
          dexterity both  modify  the  ability  to  hit  an  opponent.   In
          addition this skill increases with the level of the character.


            - Throwing/Bows

               Using stand-off missile  weapons  and  throwing  objects  is
          included  in  this  skill.   Different  stats  apply to different
          weapons, but may modify the distance an object  is  thrown/fired,
          the  amount  of  damage  done, and the ability to hit a creature.
          This skill increases with the level of the character.


            - Saving Throw

               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  the
          effects  of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.  Note
          that this does not include spells cast on the player by  his  own
          stupidity,  such  as  quaffing  a  nasty  potion.   This  ability
          increases with the level of the character,  but  then  most  high
          level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to even
          out.


            - Stealth

               The  ability  to  move  silently  about  is   very   useful.
          Characters   with   good   stealth  can  usually  surprise  their
          opponents, gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may  fail  to
          notice  a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
          certain fights.


            - Disarming

               Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  and
          includes   picking  locks  on  traps  and  doors.   Note  that  a
          successful disarming will gain  the  character  some  experience.
          The  character  must have found a trap before it can be disarmed.
          Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and
          this ability increases with the level of the character.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            - Using Magical Devices

               Using a magical device such as  a  wand  or  staff  requires
          experience  and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and priests
          are therefore much better at using a magical device  than  say  a
          fighter.   This  skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
          with the level of the character.


            - Perception

               Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  without
          actively  seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon race
          and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.


            - Searching

               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
          and  traps  on  chests.   Rogues  are  the best at searching, but
          mages,  rangers,  and  priests  are  good  at  it.   Intelligence
          modifies  your  ability  at searching, and your ability will also
          increase with your level.


            - Infra Vision

               Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since most
          of  the  dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the
          player to see walls  and  objects.   Infra-vision  will  allow  a
          character  to  see  any  warm-blooded  creatures  up to a certain
          distance.  This ability works equally well with  or  with  out  a
                                                      MORIA
          cold blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by  a  light
          source.

                 ________ _ ____

               There are eight different races that you can choose from  in
          MORIA
          be, and each race has it's own adjustments to a character's stats
          and abilities.


            - Human

               The human  is  the  base  character,  all  other  races  are
          compared  to  him.  Human's can choose any class, and are average
          at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other
          race, because of their shorter life-spans.  No racial adjustments
          occur to character's choosing human.


            - Half-Elf

               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
          not  as  strong.   Half-elves  are  slightly better at searching,
          disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they  are  not  as
          good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any class.


            - Elf

               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as  good  at
          fighting.   They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans
          or half-elves, and also have better wisdom.  Elves are better  at
          searching,  disarming,  perception,  stealth, and magic, but they
          are not as good at hand weapons.   Elves  may  choose  any  class
          except Paladin.


            - Halfling

               Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
          have  good  saving throws.  They also are very good at searching,
          disarming,  perception,  and  stealth;  so  they  make  excellent
          thieves (but prefer to be called burglars...).  They will be much
          weaker than humans, and no good at bashing.  Halflings have  fair
          infra-vision,  so  can  detect  warm  creatures  at  a  distance.
          Halflings can choose between being a fighter, mage, or rogue.


            - Gnome

               Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger  than  halflings.
          They, like the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.
          Gnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill something  in  a
          humorous  way,  so much the better.  Gnomes make excellent mages,
          and have very good saving throws.  They are  good  at  searching,
          disarming,  perception,  and  stealth.  They have lower strengths
          and constitutions then humans  so  they  are  not  very  good  at
          fighting  with  hand  weapons.  Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so
          can detect warm creatures at a  distance.   A  gnome  may  choose
          between being a fighter, mage, priest, or rogue.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            - Dwarf

               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and  fighters  of  legend.
          Since  dungeons  are  the  natural  home  of  a  dwarf,  they are
          excellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves  tend  to  be
          stronger,  have  higher  constitutions,  but  are slower and less
          intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and  are
          somewhat  wise,  they  resist  spells  which  are  cast  on them.
          Dwarves  also  have   good   infra-vision   because   they   live
          underground.  They do have one big draw-back though.  Dwarves are
          loud-mouthed and proud, singing  in  loud  voices,  arguing  with
          themselves  for  no  good  reason,  screaming  out  challenges at
          imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.


            - Half-Orc

               Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and decent  priests,  but
          are  terrible  at  magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
          and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.   Half-Orcs
          are;  let's  face  it,  ugly.  They tend to pay more for goods in
          town.  Half-Orcs do make good priest's and rogues, for the simple
          reason  that  Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots
          of hit points.


            - Half-Troll

               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest  hit
          points  of  any  character  race.   They are also very stupid and
          slow.  They will make great fighters and iffy priests.  They  are
          bad  at  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They are
          so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their  presence.   They  also
          happen to be fun to run...

                 ________ _ _____

               Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a  class.
          Some classes will not be available to certain races; for instance
          a  Half-Troll  cannot  become  a  Paladin.   For  the  first  few
          adventures  it  is  suggested  that  you  run a warrior or rogue.
          Spell casting generally requires a more experienced  player  that
          is familiar with survival techniques.


            - Warrior

               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
          his  problems  by  cutting  them to pieces, but will occasionally
          fall back on the help of a magical device.  His prime  stats  are
          Strength  and  Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really help
          at times.  A Warrior will be good at Fighting and  Throwing/Bows,
          but bad at most other skills.


            - Mage

               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
          his  way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic
          to defeat, deceive, confuse, and to escape with.  A mage  is  not
          really  complete without a golf-cart of magical devices to use in
          addition to his spells.  He can master the higher  level  magical
          devices  far  easier  than  anyone  else, and has the best saving
          throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence  and
          Dexterity  are  his  primary stats.  There is no rule that says a
          mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.


            - Priest

               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
          dungeon  only  to  destroy  the  evil  that  lurks within, and if
          treasure just happens to fall into their  packs;  well,  so  much
          more  to the glory of their church!  Priests receive their spells
          from a diety, and therefore do not choose which spells they  will
          learn.   He  is familiar with magical devices, preferring to call
          them instruments of god, but is not as good as a  mage  in  their
          use.   Priests have good saving throws, and make decent fighters,
          preferring blunt weapons over edged ones.   Wisdom  and  Charisma
          are the priests primary stats.

           The Dungeons of MORIA


            - Rogue

               A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,
          but  is  capable  of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is
          the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him
          to  over-come.   A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak
          around many creatures without having to fight, or  sneak  up  and
          get  the  first  blow.   A  rogue's perception is higher than any
          other class, and many times he will notice a trap or secret  door
          before  having  to  search.   A  rogue is better than warriors or
          paladins with magical devices, but still can not  rely  on  their
          performance.   A  rogue's  primary  stats  are  Intelligence  and
          Dexterity.


            - Ranger

               A Ranger is a fighter/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
          best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.  The
          ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but is capable
          of learning all but the most powerful spell.  Because a ranger is
          really a dual class character, it  requires  more  experience  to
          advance  him.  A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
          searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
          His primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.


            - Paladin

               A Paladin is a fighter/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
          second  only  to  the warrior class, but not very good at missile
          weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then  the  priest,
          and  can  receive  all  but  the most powerful prayer.  Because a
          paladin is really  a  dual  class  character,  it  requires  more
          experience  to  advance  him.  A paladin lacks much in the way of
          abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  perception,  searching,  and
          magical  devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to his divine
          alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Charisma.

               All commands are  entered  by  pressing  a  single  key,  or
          control  sequence  (holding down the control key while pressing a
          key).  If a particular command  requires  additional  action,  it
          will  be  prompted  for, with one exception.  When a direction is
          required, no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response
          is given.



          2.2.2.1  Note On <Dir> -

               In the following instructions, the symbol <Dir> refers to  a
          numeric  direction  based on your keypad.  It is not valid to use
          the number '5' in this context.  One exception to  this  is  with
          movement, in which case '5' will rest the character for one turn.

               Commands which require a direction will not prompt  you  for
          one,  unless  you  input  an  illegal  direction.   Just  enter a
          direction after the entering the command.

            Movement

               Movement is  accomplished  by  using  your  numeric  keypad.
          Simply  press  a  number and your character will move one step in
          that direction.  Pressing a '5' is equivalent to waiting for  one
          round  (More  efficient  resting  over  long  periods  of time is
          accomplished by using the Rest command).  You can only move  onto
          and through floor spots, and only if they contain no creatures or
          obstructing objects such as a closed door.

               Moving your character  one  step  at  a  time  can  be  time
          consuming  and  boring, so a faster method has been supplied.  By
          using the Move command '.', you may move  in  a  direction  until
          something  interesting  happens.   For  instance, by pressing the
          period key '.' followed by the direction 8, your character  would
          continue  to  move  up the screen, only coming to a stop after at
          least one condition is satisfied.  These conditions are:

          1.  A creature appears upon the screen, or a creature already  on
              the screen moves.

          2.  You move next to an  object,  or  feature  such  as  a  door,
              staircase, or trap.

          3.  You come to  a  wall,  and  have  more  than  one  choice  of
              directions  from  which  to  continue,  or  are  in a dead in
              passage.

          4.  You come to a junction of several passages.

            B <Dir> - Bash

               The Bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, or
          bashing an opponent.  Two main factors determine the ability of a
          character to bash; their weight and their strength.  In addition,
          when bashing an opponent, you will either perform a body bash, or
          if wielding a  shield,  perform  a  shield  bash  which  is  more
          effective.

               Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but this
          will  not  generally  be  a problem.  Doors that have been jammed
          closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing.   Locked  doors
          may  also  be  bashed  open.   Note that bashing a door open will
          permanently break it.

               Bashing a creature has effects on both the  player  and  his
          opponent.   Depending  on  a character's dexterity, he may or may
          not be thrown off-balance allowing free moves to  his  opponents.

                                       16

           The Dungeons of MORIA


          If   the   bash  is  successful,  the  opponent  will  be  thrown
          off-balance for 1 to 3 turns, thus allowing  the  character  free
          hits or a chance to run.

               A player automatically performs a shield bash instead  of  a
          body  bash,  if  he is currently wearing a shield.  A shield bash
          adds the damage of a shield to that  of  the  bash,  so  is  more
          effective.   Note  that  size and material both affect the damage
          that a shield will do.


            C       - Print character (to screen or file)

               This  command  allows  the  player  to  either  display  his
          character on the terminal screen, or to print an entire character
          info listing to a file.  If printed to a file, history, equipment
          list, and an inventory list are included.


            D <Dir> - Disarm a trap.

               You can attempt to disarm floor traps,  or  trapped  chests.
          If  you fail to disarm a trap, there is a chance that you blunder
          and set it off.  You can only disarm a  trap  on  a  chest  after
          finding it with the search command.


            E       - Eat some food.

               A character must eat occasionally to remain effective.  As a
          character  grows  hungry,  a message will appear at the bottom of
          the screen saying "Hungry".  If a character remains  hungry  long
          enough, he will become weak and eventually start fainting.


            F       - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.

               If your character is currently using a lamp for  light,  and
          if  he has a flask of oil in inventory, he may refill the lamp by
          using this command.  A lamp is capable of a maximum of 5500 turns
          of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil contained in it.


            L       - Display map co-ordinates.

               The Location command will display your  character's  current
          co-ordinates  as  shown  on  a  printed map (printed with the 'P'
          command).  Sectors contain up to 44 rows by 99 columns each.  The
          Location  command  will  display  the character's current row and
          column map co-ordinates, as well as the sector number.


            P       - Print map to file.

               The Print command will write an entire map  of  the  dungeon
          floor  explored to a file.  Since the dungeon floor is large, the
          map is broken up into sectors, each containing up to 44  rows  by
          99 columns.
