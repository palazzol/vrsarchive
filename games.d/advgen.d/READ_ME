This is an adventure-generator for the "adv" game by Chris Torek
(chris@maryland.uucp).

To build it, check the Makefile and run "make". The most likely things
to be changed are:
	INTERPRETER	The full pathname of "adv". A suitable #! header
			will be prepended to adventure files, making them
			directly executable (on BSD-derived systems). This
			only works if you have a version of "adv" patched to
			ignore any such initial header; if you don't, define
			INTERPRETER to be empty.
	MAXCODE		The maximum size of the generated code; on small
			address-space systems cut this down to, say, 10000
			to reduce the size of "advgen".
	MAXVOCAB	The maximum number of entries in the verb and noun
			tables; try MAXVOCAB=200 on small systems.

This has only been built and run on 4.2bsd on a VAX 11/750.  I am
unaware of any machine or version dependencies, but they are probably
there.

If your system doesn't have getopt(3) it should have!  Several versions
have been posted to Usenet recently, any of which will work correctly
for "advgen".

If your system doesn't have adv(6) this program is useless to you.  The
program was posted to the net by chris@maryland.uucp, and a version
patched to use the curses library is available from chris@hwcs.uucp
(no relation!).

The file Pirate.adv is an extended example of an input file, produced
by de-compiling and massaging the "p" adventure distributed with adv.
I hope the author will forgive me for revealing his secrets; however,
the cat was out of the bag in any case :-) as soon as the source of adv
was distributed.
