  1.	Replace Message section by Constant section, allowing
	symbolic names for numeric constants.

  2.	Further extend by allowing constant expressions.

  3.	Allow general boolean expressions in LHS of Daemon and
	Action rules; parse as expression tree, transform tree to
	conjunctive normal form, and produce appropriate number of
	rules, one for each disjunct.  NB for daemons, the percentage
	should be attached to setting a control variable, which is reset
	to false on each turn, and is added as a conjunct to the LHS of
	each disjunct.

  4.	Allow <, <=, != and >= in relations.

  5.	Allow "alphabeticiser" (e.g. ^) as prefix to characters to allow
	anything to appear there.
	[Done 16/9/85 - restricted to allowing ^ as initial character of
	identifiers starting with a digit, to avoid nastiness with ",",
	"*", newline or space in identifiers messing up the word declarations
	in the output file.]
