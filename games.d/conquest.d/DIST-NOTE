Bill,

The reason I want to limit re-distribution is to assure source code
integrity when I get modification requests...  This version has been
played by myself about a dozen times, but there will still be many
many bugs and changes... I do want as wide a distribution as possible,
so, you have permission to distribute this as widely
as desired.  

Thanks!
Ed
