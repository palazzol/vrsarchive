	[The following is from the author...   -br]
[[This is the first posting of my multi player game "conquest".  
CONQUEST is a middle earth multi-player computer game in which each
player is the leader of a nation, composed of people (humans, orcs,
elves, dwarves), resources, and land.  Several neat features are
supported, chiefly non player countries and magic powers.

The game is somewhat like the game "empire", so I would think that any
news articles about it should go to either rec.games.empire or,
preferably, rec.games.]]
