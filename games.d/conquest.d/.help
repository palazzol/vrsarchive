                           WELCOME TO CONQUEST

CONQUEST is a multi player computer game designed to run under the UNIX 
operating system.  In CONQUEST,  each player is the leader of a nation, 
composed of people (humans, orcs, elves, dwarves), recourses, and land.  
Each ruler can customize the nation at creation, by chosing their race and
by giving their nation powers (magic, combat factor, location, speed...)
and resources (civilians, troops, iron, gold...). Play involves building, 
moving, and controlling armies and navies, diplomacy with other players, 
and adjusting economic activity, which is primarily geared to the production 
of gold for your treasury.  Iron is needed, however to build ships & armies, 
and food is needed to prevent revolts and keep people alive.  

Command line format: conquest [-maxhp]	-m   make a world

				THE WORLD

The Conquest world is very bloody, and a player needs skills at war gaming,
diplomacy, and building an economy to succeed.  Rival races are constantly 
at war, and the world starts filled with player nations, random peoples
(lizard men in their cities of gold, barbarians, nomads, pirates, brigands),
and both hostile and friendly computer controlled non player countries.
Conquest can be played solitaire.  The computer uses an highly intelligent
movement algorithm to run the armies and navies of these non player
nations, and has intelligent algorithms built in that control these nations
diplomacy, construction, and economies.  You can find NPCs allied with 
you against a common enemy,  but can also suddenly be stabbed in the 
back and find hostile NPC armies at your doorstep.

                     WHAT IS WHAT IN THE WORLD

The world is composed of a 2 dimensional map of sectors, created by the 
computer at the beginning of the game.  Each sector has about 10 unique 
characteristics (altitude, gold, vegitation...).   For example;

SECTOR ELEVATIONS include:	WATER    '~'   	PEAK     '#' 
		MOUNTAIN '^'	HILL     '%'	CLEAR    '-' 

SECTOR VEGETATION
Uninhabitable Areas (do not produce food and people simply do not like)
     VOLCANO   'V'	DESERT 'D'     JUNGLE  'J'
     WASTE     'W'	ICE 'I'        SWAMP  'S'

Inhabitable (people like, number is relative value of food production)
     LIGHT VEGETATION 	'6'         GOOD   '9'     FOREST   '3'
     WOOD      		'7'         BARREN '4'

CONQUEST is designed so each race likes their appropriate terrain.  Elves 
like woods & forests,  Humans like good & light vegitation, and Orcs and 
Dwarves like hills and mountains.

                     	RACES OF THE WORLD

ORC	'O'  	Poor at combat but they reproduce like mad.  Orcs reproduce
		like mad, and can go over 10% reproduction ceiling. 
		They are lousy fighters and are led by a minor monster, which 
		means their army #0 is very potent.
ELF	'E'	Great at defense and quick, but few in numbers.  They start 
		with VOID power, which is perhaps the most potent power in the 
		game, but which costs them an extra distribution point.  
DWARF	'D'	Dwarves are good at combat, but slow and few in numbers.  They 
		start with MINER power, which allows them to quickly mine 
		iron/jewels, and thus build up their combat skills and powers.
HUMAN	'H'	The Flexible race, above average at everything.  Humans start
		with reasonable numbers of people, and WARRIOR power, which
		gives them +10% in all combats.  They have OK reproduction
		and good movement.
LIZARD 'L'	(NPC only)  An ancient race bound to their cities of gold 
PIRATE 'P'	(NPC only)  Wandering pirates/brigands intent on plunder
NOMAD  'N'	(NPC only)  Wandering Nomads Tribes.  Will they leave you alone?
BARBARIAN  'B' 	(NPC only)  Indigenous natives

			POSSIBLE SECTOR DESIGNATIONS

    MINE       'm'   Produces 100*Iron*People Talons + Produces Iron Ores
    FARM       'f'   Produces 100*Vegetation*People Talons + Produces Food 
    GOLD MINE  '$'   Produces 100*Gold*People Talons + Produces Jewels 
    CASTLE     '!'   Fortified Cities of the Lizards (only)
    DEVASTATED 'x'   devastated sector

    CITY       'c'   Cities and Capitols are the bases of your power.  They
    CAPITOL    'C'   are the only places you can draft armies or construct 
		     ships. Drafting only works if the sectors people is
		     greater than your total civilians divided by the quantity
		     16+(number of sectors)/2.  Cities give 750 talons per
		     person and Capitols give 1000 talons per person. Cities and
		     Capitols cost more to redesignate.

THIS STUFF IS NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THIS VERSION!!!!
Victory points are based on your nations class and the following table.
For example, an empire gains points by controlling sectors, people, gold, and
soldiers. Some of these types also have magic powers.

			POSSIBLE ARMY STATUS

MARCH   :Marching doubles army movement at the expense of combat strength.
SCOUT   :Scouts avoid any enemy, if possible, and can move through hostile
        :   armies, but must have less than 25 men per army and can not take
	:   even unowned land.  They are useful to check out the  map and
        :   to determine the enemy combat strength.
ATTACK  :Armies in this mode can take owned sectors, initiate
        :   combat, and have they reasonable movement rates.
DEFEND  :In this mode, can take owned sectors and have good defense 
        :   and movement, but can not initiate combat.
GARRISON:This mode offers the strongest defense but is used only in cities
	:   and castles.  Garrisons may not move.

Note: It takes 75 men to take a sector.  Your attack bonus increases by 
	5% if you take over a non player country. Fortresses can be built 
	in cities/capitols at a cost of 1000*(2**fort level) gold pieces.
END
			NON PLAYER NATIONS 

Diplomacy with non player nations is important in this game.  This determines
if you get attacked or not.  

hint;  use your gold talons to bribe non player countries that are at war with
	you.  It may not work, but may allow you some breathing room and 
	at some point the gold becomes irrelevant anyway.
hint;  you had best not be at war with NPCs when you bribe them.  If you are,
	you have just wasted your money.
hint;  if you are in a mutual confederacy with a non player nation of the
	same race there is a % chance that they come over to your side!!!
END
			ADDITIONAL NOTES ON COMBAT

Losses per unit are scaled by (1.2 / 1 + combat plus) so if you have a high
	combat plus your losses will be less.
You can expect to take several turns to reduce a large army, especially
	on a City or Capitol, as the defenders will draft new troops each turn
Ships (believe it or not) are more powerful than you might expect.  They
	permit you to rapidly relocate large armies or large numbers of
	civilians to strategic points.  Their movement is 3x that of
	a land army and they pay 1 move point per sector.  I will warn
	you, however, that naval combat has not been play tested.

THE NEXT PAGE IS THE COMBAT RESULTS TABLE			
	basically the attacker wants a high roll and the defender wants
	a low roll.

  	                RULES ON IRON, FOOD, AND GOLD

FOOD:      You MUST have enough food to feed your people... One civilian eats 
	one unit of food, and one soldier eats two units.  If you run out of 
	food, half the difference of people in cities die.  Your Granary
	will store 3x your civilian population in food.  The remainder 
	is converted to gold talons at a rate of 1 per food point.
IRON:      You need to have iron to draft new military.  Ten iron units
	will suffice to equip one soldier.  You also need 200 gold talons to 
	train a soldier. One person produces one iron per point of mineral in 
	the sector per turn.  An ammount of Iron (based on the number of troops 
	you have) can be used to buy +1% in attack or defense.
JEWELS:    You can have a maximum of 10 talons debt for every jewel
	point that you mined.  After that point, you undergo a TAX REVOLT,
	which has not yet been implemented. Thus gold can be negative to 
	a certain level.  Jewels are also used in magic, and 100000 Jewels
	will buy you one random new power (command M).  You can have 10
	talons in the treasury for each jewel (gold based economy).  After
	that, your gold talons will be converted to jewels at a 10:1 ratio.
END

END
			FINAL HINTS

You would be a fool not to buy a reproduction rate of 9-10% percent.
Extra movement is very useful (especially if your movement is 6)
Buy civilians instead of military (who dont reproduce).  This assumes
	that you have a military of about 1500 men for taking land.
Take as much land as possible in the beginning.

ONE NOTE ON HOW THE GAME WORKS>> you will find that when you do something
that effects another country and then logoff/logon, that change will not
be displayed (ie. if you bribe them or overrun one of their armies).  There
is no easy fix for this.  The changes occurred!!! the computer knows about
them, and if you logged in as their nation you would see the army gone or
the diplomatic status changed, but you can not see them because only
a selected part of the turns total moves are updated when you log in.

<To be added to later>
