			NOTES TO INSTALLER OF CONQUEST

What you have here is a copyrighted beta test version of CONQUEST.  Included
in this file are the following:

	1) A Brief Description of Conquest
	2) Installation (unpacking) Instructions
	3) A Manifest (after you have installed it)
	4) Compilation Instructions
	5) administration instructions
	6) execution instructions (how to play)
	7) a list of further enhancements I am planning on making
	8) Bug list and unimplemented options

Remember this is an BETA version, not to be redistributed, and
probably has bugs.  Any comments and bug reports would be appreciated.

-----------------------------------------------------------
I   A Brief Description of Conquest
-----------------------------------------------------------

READ FILE .help FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CONQUEST.  The help file can be
read in nice format by using "conquest -h" after compilation.

-----------------------------------------------------------
II  Installation (unpacking) Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

This program came in three shar scripts, which can be unpacked
by using "sh filename".  If you are reading this, you know this.

-----------------------------------------------------------
III A Manifest (after you have unpacked it) of Conquest Files is a follows
	/bin/ls -aFC should look like this
-----------------------------------------------------------

THE FOLLOWING 2 FILES SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE TYPE OF GAME YOU WISH

header file: header.h   
makefile: Makefile

suport files: .nations .help README 

C code: 
	combat.c      forms.c       main.c        newlogin.c    update.c
	commands.c    io.c          makeworld.c   npc.c
	execute.c     magic.c       move.c        reports.c

-----------------------------------------------------------
IV  Compilation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Browse the file header.h.  This sets up configurable parameters for the
game.  This program should be easy to compile (although it never really is -- 
I have tried to make it as easy as possible). If there are problems check 
the following.

1.  Sometimes termcap/termlib... are not on systems.  You will know this
    is the error if all the '.c' files compile but will not compile together.
    Unreferenced symbol errors will occur.  Try changing the name
    of the library (or eliminating it on some systems) on the final compile 
    and link step.
2.  Find your nearest unix guru and ask him.

-----------------------------------------------------------
V   administration instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have compiled it, this is how you administer the game.
I recommend following these instructions once yourself in a mock game 
(ie. no other players) for a few turns to get things straight.  Then you 
can add other players.

You can type the following commands to help administer the game

Make clobber:  clobber everything but the source (destroys executable)
Make clean:    clean up objects (does not destroy executable)
Make install:	Installs executable & data in appropriate directories (header.h)
Make docs:	Creates documentation from help file

Make lint:	produces lint output for the game.  
run:		read it, it permits you to run the update automatically

This is the command line format for conquest:
	Cmd line format: conquest [-maxhp]
		(no options) play the game
		-m   make a world (file '.data' must not exist, must be god)
		-a   add new player (must be god)
		-x   execute program (must be god)
		-h   print help text
		-p   print a map to stdout (must be god)

Again, prior to the compile, you should have browsed the header.h file.  
Follow the comments.  

Then create the world via:
	<conquest -m>    this will make your world.  Try it.
			 This also sets up npc nations as per the .nations file
			 npc stats can be adjusted by editing .nations
			 prior to making the world.  Non player nations have
			 the same password as god.

Add 0 or more players via
	<conquest -a>    which should be self explanitory

Now type <conquest> and log in as <god> with the appropriate super user
password.  

Learn the commands (Type '?' to get help) & play around to get your 
syntax right.

Try logging in as either a player or non player nation (they use the super
user passwd) and noticing any differences.

Now move around on the map and learn where the players are
positioned.  If there is a problem (they are surrounded by water...), 
use the redesignate command to change elvation or vegitation. 
In the worst case, god can destroy a nation
with 'c', the change nation command.  Once you
think the game will be fair, it is time to allow players to proceed.

Now you are all set -- play via 
	<conquest>

and update (every midnight via at...) with
	<conquest -x>
an "at" script to do this is contained in the shell script "run".

I have attempted to give enough aides to playing that it should
take no longer than fifteen minutes per day to play.  If it takes
more, something is wrong.

*WARNING*  IF YOU REMOVE THE .data FILE, REMEMBER TO ZERO THE .execute
file or the world will be screwed up when you recreate it.  This will
cause you to spend hours browsing the source code and result in untold
frustration (I speak from experience).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Trade is unimplemented
Naval combat and movement has not been system tested
Cities do not have garrison armies
