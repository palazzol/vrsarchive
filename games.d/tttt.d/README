This is version 2 of my 4 by 4 version of tic-tac-toe with
"wraparound edges" (so you can have off-center diagonal wins).

It has an ever-so-slightly improved computer player, and a vastly
improved user interface, including online help,  being able to
change who moves first, and change the number of players (0, 1, or 2).

I've compiled it under 4.3 BSD Unix, but it should compile
ok just about everywhere that has a curses package.

Edit the Makefile as necessary, then make.

If you improve the code, please let me know.  I'd be interested
in seeing any changes to it.

This program is public domain.
