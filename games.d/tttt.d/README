This is a 4 by 4 version of tic-tac-toe with "wraparound
edges" (so you can have off-center diagonal wins).

I've compiled it under 4.3 BSD Unix, but it should compile
ok just about everywhere that has a curses package.

Edit the Makefile as necessary, then make.

If you improve the code, please let me know.  I'd be interested
in seeing any changes to it.

This program is public domain.
