.SH DESCRIPTION
Tic-Tac-Toc-Toe is a 4 by 4 version of Tic-Tac-Toe
with wraparound edges.  The goal of the game is to
connect 4 of your pieces in a row, either horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally.  Note that diagonal wins can
be off-center, due to the wraparound edges (and hence, there
are no corners in the board).
.PP
To play, simply press the letter and number corresponding
to select the appropriate square, and the computer will then
take its turn.
.PP
The first player to connect four squares in a row wins.
.PP
If the board becomes filled without a winner, it is a tie game.
.PP
If there are no possible wins on the board before the board
is entirely filled, the game ends as a tie game.

.SH HISTORY
This program was originally written for an Advanced Logic
Design class, as a high level version of the program to
later be implemented in hardware.
.PP
It was converted to run with curses in an attempt to procrastinate
working on the hardware implementation.
.PP
As people requested them, additional features were added, even
some that people didn't want (like a slightly better computer player).
.SH BUGS
You can still beat the computer player.
