This program was written for 4.2 BSD running on a VAX 750.   It makes
use of sockets for communicating between two copies of the program.
Therefore, porting this program to other flavors of UNIX will be painful.

This program requires the "dpy" library module which I have previously
posted to net.sources.  If you do not have this module, then you must
get it from someone else on the net.  I can no longer supply copies of
dpy since this is my last day at Daisy.

The following files need to be handled specially:

objects.war	This is the default object initialization file.  Copy it
		to /usr/games/lib.

boards.war	This is an example setup file.  Each player actually has
		their own setup file ".warsetups" in their HOME directory.

war.6		This is the manual page for war.  Copy it to /usr/man/man6.

There are still several features that I would like to see in the game,
but I am out of time (see the bug list in the man page).  However, the
current version still contains enough features to be playable.  Enjoy!
