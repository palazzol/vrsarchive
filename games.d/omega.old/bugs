The game has a few other bugs which I haven't looked for yet but in
general it's pretty fun except for the fact that it uses curses which
is rather inefficient. I have finally gotten the Head of the Goblin
King for the Duke and am going for the Demonhide Armor...

	Other minor bugs which I haven't looked for yet:
	1) Saving the game when you're a "three time loser"
           does not save that fact. When you restart and get
	   put into jail, you are given probation.
	2) When you restore a saved game, it does not draw you
	   on the screen until you do a ^R.
	3) When you find a secret passage using the search command,
	   it does not redraw the newfound square. Again you must use
	   the ^R command.
