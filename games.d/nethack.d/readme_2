	[OK hack fans, here it is.  This posting and the following 15
	 compose the latest version of hack, known as nethack.  -br]

[[From the author:
To make NetHack on any Unix system, copy "Makefile.unix" to "Makefile",
edit it and "config.h" then type "make".  I've tested it out on 4.2BSD and
System V Unix systems, and there seems to be no obvious build problems.

To make NetHack on a SCO Xenix system, copy "Makefile.xenix" to "Makefile",
edit "config.h" (Makefile.xenix" should??? be OK), then type "make".  I know
that it won't run, as it exists now, under Xenix, but maybe someone out there
can get it working - especially the hackers at SCO - maybe in time for the
2.3 release????

To make NetHack on a Dos PC, copy "Makefile.pc" to "Makefile", edit config.h,
then type "make".  This one may not even link properly, although it should
compile.

If anyone comes across a bug, or manages to get the program to run under Xenix
or Dos, ***please*** send me a set of diffs or whatever so that I can patch
my code and get a release with the proper information out to the net in
general.  Also, if anyone wants to put the 3.51 --> 3.61 PC Hack changes into
the source, send me diffs.  Once I have a significantly large set of mods, I
will send them to the moderator of comp.sources.games so that he can post them.

I will try to keep the postings of diffs up to a level of about one posting per
month, although I am taking three weeks vacation about a month from now.  I can
hopefully get the first set of mods out before I take off.
