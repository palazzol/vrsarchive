---------------- FLIBS Revision 1.1 Distribution Notes --------------

This game is distributed to the world.  Play it and enjoy.  Sometimes
it's dull, sometimes it's interesting, all of the time it's a CPU hog.

I wrote this program to run under UNIX 4.2bsd with termcaps.  Other people
may want to move it to System V or even use DPY with it.  The operating
system dependent stuff is in "fopsys.c" and the terminal package
dependent stuff is in "fterminal.c".

If you do change it, could you send the new source code so that (a) I can
give it to others who want it, and (b) I can store it away for future
reference.

To make FLIBS, unshar it and make it.
