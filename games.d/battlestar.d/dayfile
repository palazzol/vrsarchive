Falling 10 agonizing meters into spray, only droplets of the stream are
left to dance off the floor below.  I thought I saw a sparkle of gold
at the bottom of the falls, but now it is gone.  There is no way down,
even with a strong rope. ****

246: You are in a low passage.
247 160 0 0 0 0 0 0
The passage is partially flooded here and it may be hazardous to proceed.
Water is surging from the tunnel and heading out to sea. Strange moaning
noises rise above the rushing of the water.  They are as thin as a whispering
wind yet penetrate to my very soul.  I think we have come too far...
The passage continues -.***

247: The walls are very close together here.

I can barely squeeze through the jagged opening. Slimy sea weeds provide
no footing at all. This tunnel seems to be an ancient lava tube. There is
a large room -.***

248: You are in the cathedral room.

Your light casts ghostly shadows on the walls but cannot pierce the 
engulfing darkness overhead. The sound of water dripping echoes in the void.
*I can see no passages leading out of this room.  We have definitely
come too far.*** 

249: You are walking through a very round tunnel.

The round walls of this tunnel are amazingly smooth to the touch. A little
trickle of water flows down the center. The tunnel climbs steadily +.
The cave is beginning to flood again!  Let's get out of here! ***

0 0 0 248 253 1 0 0
This small chamber with a flat stone floor is to one side of the cathedral 
room. We appear to be at the bottom of a tall narrow shaft. There are many 
puddles of water here. A staircase hewn from solid rock and black lava 
leads up.*** The cathedral room is +.

251: You are in a wide chamber.

Water is sprinkling from the ceiling here. A shallow pool populated by a 
myriad of blind white creatures sparkles in your light. Tiny shrimp and
crabs scurry away, frightened by the blinding rays.** The cave 
continues - and -.

252: You are at the top of a sloping passage.

There is much algae growing here, both green and brown specimens. 
Water from an underground sea surges and splashes against the slope of
the rock. The walls glisten with shiny minerals.  High above, light
filters in through a narrow shaft.**  A hallway here runs -
and -.

253: You are in an elaborately tiled room.
0 0 258 0 0 0 250 0
Large colorful tiles plate the floor and walls.  The ceiling is a mosaic
of gems set in gold.  Hopefully it is only our footsteps that are echoing in
this hollow chamber.** The room continues -.  A stone staircase
leads down.*

254: You are at a dead end.

The walls here are alive with dark mussels.  They click their shells menacingly
if we disturb them. ** The only exit is +.*

255: The tunnel is very low here.

I practically have to crawl on my knees to pass through this opening. The
air is stiflingly damp, but I can't hear any sounds of water dripping.**
The crawlspace continues -. The tunnel seems wider +.

256: This is the supply room.

Picks and shovels line the walls here, as well as hard hats, boxes of
dynamite, and a cartload of very high grade gold and silver ore.** 
A tunnel leads off +.*

257: You have found a secret entrance to the catacombs.
0 0 0 0 216 1 252 0
I have a sickening feeling that we should not have entered the catacombs.
Below is a wet, seaweed covered floor. Above is a way out. ****

258: You are in the catacombs.
0 0 260 253 0 0 0 0
Ornate tombs and piles of treasure line the walls.  Long spears with many
blades, fine swords and coats of mail, heaps of coins, jewelry, pottery, 
and golden statues are tribute of past kings and queens.** The catacombs
continue - and -.

259: You are crawling on your stomach.
0 0 261 255 0 0 0 0
The passage is quite narrow and jagged, but the rock is no longer lava.
It appears to be a form of granite.** The crawlspace continues -, 
but I would just as soon go -.

260: You are in the Sepulcher.
0 0 0 258 0 0 0 0
A single tomb is here.  Encrusted with diamonds and opals, and secured with 
straps of a very hard, untarnished silver, this tomb must be of a great king.
Vases overflowing with gold coins stand nearby.  A line of verse on the wall
reads, "Three he made and gave them to his daughters."****

You are at the top of a flooded shaft.  About a meter below the edge,
dark water rises and falls to the rhythm of the sea.  A ladder goes
down into water here.***  A small crawlspace goes -.

262: You are at the bottom of a ladder.
0 0 0 0 261 1 263 0
This is a narrow platform to rest on before we continue either up or down this
rickety wooden ladder.****

263: You are standing in several inches of water.
264 0 265 266 262 1 0 0
This seems to be a working mine. Many different tunnels wander off following
glowing veins of precious metal.  The floor is flooded here since we must
be nearly at sea level.  A ladder leads up. ****

264: The tunnel here is blocked by broken rocks.
0 263 0 0 0 0 0 0
The way is blocked, but if you had some dynamite, we might be able to blast our
way through.*  The passage goes -.**

265: The tunnel is too flooded to proceed.
0 0 0 263 0 0 0 0
Hidden shafts could swallow us if we tried to continue on down this tunnel.
The flooding is already up to my waist.  Large crystals overhead shimmer
rainbows of reflected light.***  Let's go -.

A meandering gold laden vein of quartz and blooming crystals of diamonds

Beds of ferns and palm leaves make several cozy nests along the walls. In the
center of the room is a throne of gold and silver which pulls out into a bed
of enormous size.***  A passageway leads down to the -.

I can see daylight far up at the mouth of the pit.   A cool draft wafts down.
There doesn't seem to be any way out, and I don't remember how we came in.
If you had a rope it might be possible to climb out. ****
