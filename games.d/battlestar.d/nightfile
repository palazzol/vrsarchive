The ceiling here sparkles with iridiscent gems and minerals. Colorful starfish

I can barely squeeze through the jagged opening. Slimy sea weeds provide
no footing at all. This tunnel seems to be an ancient lava tube.  There is
a large room +.***

248: You are in the cathedral room.

Your light casts ghostly shadows on the walls but cannot pierce the 
engulfing darkness overhead. The sound of water dripping echoes in the void.
*I can see no passages leading out of this room.*** 

249: You are walking through a very round tunnel.

trickle of water flows down the center.  The tunnel climbs steadily +.

This small chamber with a flat stone floor is to one side of the cathedral 
room. We appear to be at the bottom of a tall narrow shaft. There are many 
puddles of water here. A staircase hewn from solid rock and black lava 
leads up.***  The cathedral room is -.

Water is sprinkling from the ceiling here. A shallow pool populated by a 
myriad of blind white creatures sparkles in your light. Tiny shrimp and
crabs scurry away, frightened by the blinding rays.**  The cave 
continues + and +.

252: You are at the top of a sloping passage.
0 249 255 256 257 1 249 0
There is much algae growing here, both green and brown specimens. I suspect
that we are near the high tide zone, but no light can get in here. The walls
glisten with shiny minerals.**  A hallway here runs + and -.

253: You are in an elaborately tiled room.
0 0 258 0 0 0 250 0
Large colorful tiles plate the floor and walls.  The ceiling is a mosaic
of gems set in gold.  Hopefully it is only our footsteps that are echoing in
this hollow chamber.**  The room continues -.  A stone staircase leads
down.*

The walls here are alive with dark mussels.  They click their shells menacingly
if we disturb them.**  The only exit is +.*

255: The tunnel is very low here.

You practically have to crawl on your knees to pass through this opening.  The
air is stiflingly damp, but you can't hear any sounds of water dripping.**

Picks and shovels line the walls here, as well as hard hats, boxes of
dynamite, and a cartload of very high grade gold and silver ore.**

Below is a wet, seaweed covered floor.  Above is a way out.****

258: You are in the catacombs.

Ornate tombs and piles of treasure line the walls.  Long spears with many
blades, fine swords and coats of mail, heaps of coins, jewelry, pottery, 
and golden statues are tribute past kings and queens.** The catacombs
continue - and -.

259: You are crawling on your stomach.

The passage is quite narrow and jagged, but the rock is no longer lava.
It appears to be a form of granite.**  The crawlspace continues -, 
but I would just as soon go -.

260: You are in the Sepulcher.
0 0 0 258 0 0 0 0
A single tomb is here.  Encrusted with diamonds and opals, and secured with 
straps of a very hard, untarnished silver, this tomb must be of a great king.
Vases overflowing with gold coins stand nearby.  A line of verse on the wall
reads, "Three he made and gave them to his daughters."****

A ladder goes down into darkness here.***  A small crawlspace goes -.

This is a narrow platform to rest on before we continue either up or down this
rickety wooden ladder.****

This seems to be a working mine. Many different tunnels wander off following
glowing veins of precious metal.  The floor is flooded here since we must
be nearly at sea level.  A ladder leads up.****

264: The tunnel here is blocked by broken rocks.
0 263 0 0 0 0 0 0
The way is blocked, but if you had some dynamite, we might be able to blast our
way through.*  The passage goes -.**

265: The tunnel is too flooded to proceed.

Hidden shafts could swallow us if we tried to continue on down this tunnel.
The flooding is already up to my waist.  Large crystals overhead shimmer
rainbows of reflected light.***  Let's go -.

A meandering gold laden vein of quartz and blooming crystals of diamonds

Beds of ferns and palm leaves make several cozy nests along the walls. In the

At the top of the pit, a single star can be seen in the night sky.  There

how we got here.****
