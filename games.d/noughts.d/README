def.h           header.

adm.c
	cheat()         Interupt routine to run when someone trys to
			exit program.
	main()          The main program which make initialisations and
			administrates who is on the move.

inmove.c
	normal()        stops the program play self.
	inmove()        The main event loop.
	inposition()    Converts text string to position.
	emptyline()     empty a line at input.

terminal.c
	getcap()        Initialises termcap.
	pos()           Positions on the screen.
	up()            Move up one line.
	clear()         Clear screen from cursor.
	home()          Cursor home.

utboard.c
	utboard()       Draws the board.

automat.c
	automat[][]     A computer generated table which defines a finite
			automat for calculating points in a string of
			<space> o and x.

autom.c
	autom()         A subroutine which from the table automat[][]
			calculates points.

chose.c
	chose()         This one is the most central subroutine. It choses
			a move to do. You may call this the algorithm for
			chosing moves. Now it only choses the move that
			gets the highest threat and point score. To be
			better it should also test moves and see whats
			changing on the board!

catch.c
	catch()         Fetches patterns from the board and puts them in
			temporaray strings.

upd.c
	update()        This one is the second most central subroutine.
			It administrates the updating of points and
			threats. The code can be difficult to read because
			it is optimised for doing as little as possible.
			If a more complicated algorithm is used in chose()
			this have to be a fast one!

updtht.c
	updtht()        A help routine for update. It updates the points
			on the threat board.

There are three more files. Those files you don't need if you don't want
to change the computing of points. The comments are in Swedish but i don't
think that will be of any inconvinience.

make_header     The beginning of an automat.c file.

maketabell      Defines the computing of points. First there is a table
		that defines threatpoint and point for some letters. Then
		those letters are used in patterns to define where those
		points are found.

makeautomat.c   Compile this with cc and run makeautomat < maketabell to
		make a new automat.c file.

PS. If you make any improvments or/and have any suggestions please send the
improvments/suggestions to me.
