        Attached is a set of files that implement a rather macabre
version of hangman (all you sickie netters should like it :-) including
my own cursor control library.  If anyone gets really motivated, I
imagine that translating it into Berkeley Curses (which I didn't have)
and reposting it would be quite appreciated.

        DON'T CHEAT AND LOOK AT THE .hang-words FILE TO SEE WHAT THE
WORDS ARE!!!

        Have fun with this, and all messages from the ACLU or whomever
else complains about violent computer games should be routed to /dev/null!

**** Any problems encountered, bugs fixed, or great words added should
     be reported to the author (please) at either of the addresses:

     Thanks and good luck!
