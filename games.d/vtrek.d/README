Here's a simple visual Star Trek game that I recently wrote.
It's pretty much the same as other Star Trek games,  but the
visual aspect makes it a bit more entertaining.

This version seems to work OK here at purdue-ecn (4.2,4.3bsd).  It
should work on other Unix OS's with little or no changes.
It will work on CP/M if you have the Aztec C compiler and
64K of ram.  It will work on the IBM PC & compatibles with 
minor changes.

Send flames to /dev/null.  Please mail be a copy of any major
enhancements/modifications that you make.

You are free to distribute copies to anyone who wants the game,
as long as you don't sell it.

Here is a patched termio.c for the small visual trek game
posted a little while back. 
It originally would not work with a vt100 because vt100 termcap entries
were too long and because the padding information wasn't being decoded.
The "cl" and "cm" char arrays have been expanded to allow for
longer termcap entries and tputs() is now being called instead
of fputs() in the UNIX sections so as to allow the padding
information in termcap entries to be decoded.
It now works on 4.2BSD and Xenix 3.0
I guess this is for those who haven't bothered to mess about already.
(vtrek is made with -ltermcap OR -ltermlib depending on the system)
Hope this helps.

Paul's fix didn't do any padding after all, since he didn't set the variable
ospeed equal to anything.  I fixed the handling of cl, cm, etc to handle any
size that can be present in a termcap entry.  He had the right idea, but a
weak understanding of how to use tgetstr and tputs.
