Here's a simple visual Star Trek game that I recently wrote.
It's pretty much the same as other Star Trek games,  but the
visual aspect makes it a bit more entertaining.

This version seems to work OK here at purdue-ecn (4.2,4.3bsd).  It
should work on other Unix OS's with little or no changes.
It will work on CP/M if you have the Aztec C compiler and
64K of ram.  It will work on the IBM PC & compatibles with 
minor changes.

Send flames to /dev/null.  Please mail be a copy of any major
enhancements/modifications that you make.

You are free to distribute copies to anyone who wants the game,
as long as you don't sell it.
